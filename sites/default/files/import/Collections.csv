Shiels was born near Ballymoney, County Antrim. He emigrated to Canada to work on the Canadian Pacific Railway, but was injured in 1913 and disabled for life in an accident. He returned to Northern Ireland and set up business with his brother as a shipping agent and started to write. His first play - Away from the Moss, was performed by the Ulster Literary Theatre in 1918. Many of his plays, starting with Bedmates in 1921, were performed by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin where he was very popular with Dublin audiences. His plays were also performed at Belfast's Group Theatre. George Shiels plays are often described as ""kitchen dramas"" and are very popular with amateur theatre groups. Despite the limited canvas with which Shiels worked it is apparent from his work that he was keen commentator on the changing times in which he lived.

36,Anglesey Papers,D/619,,"Substantial collection of archival material consisting of approx. 12,700 documents and 50 volumes relating to the Anglesey estate in Counties Louth and Down, c 1660-1858, and the political career of Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey (1768-1854), Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1828-29 and 1830-33.  The collection includes comprehensive series of title deeds, leases, rentals, accounts, maps and surveys etc for the Anglesey estate, and that of their predecessors (i.e. the Bagenal and Bayly families) in Newry, Co. Down, Cooley and Omeath, Co. Louth and Galway town, dating from the late 17th century to 1858 when the estate was sold by the 2nd Marquess of Anglesey. A particularly fine assemblage of estate papers, the collection is most noteworthy for the long runs of agents’ correspondence that it contains, especially for the early 18th to mid 19th centuries. These papers deal with a range of typical managerial issues involved in the administration of the estate and associated business matters. There are also other, more general and miscellaneous papers that have been grouped together artificially which deal, for example, with the foundation of the Co. Louth Infirmary in 1770, the establishment of the Omeath National School and an abortive scheme for the construction of a railway link between Newry and Carlingford in 1845. The political papers featured in the Anglesey Papers are exclusively concerned with the 1st Marquess of Anglesey’s two tenures as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and largely consist of fairly complete, and at times duplicative, series of correspondence. Dealing primarily with matters of state and patronage, the papers provide a valuable commentary on the administration of Ireland both before and after Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Principal correspondents consist of official colleagues and associates. These include Lord Holland (1773-1840), the Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850), and Daniel O’Connell (1775-1847), in addition to the various Chief and Under Secretaries who served under Anglesey at Dublin Castle. Of the major issues covered, the most prominent include agitation for repeal of the Union, tithe reform and the implementation of the Great Reform Act of 1832 in Ireland. A relatively small collection of accounting records from Dublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park are also to be found.","The Anglesey Papers are particularly strong for subjects relating to, and associated with, estate management and land purchase in Ireland for the period, c 1660-1858. Of note are the long runs of agents' correspondence on the adminstration of the estate. As with other estate archives, the collection is also significant for providing testimony to the social life and background of the landed gentry and the tenants that resided on their estates.

The collection also contains a number of maps, plans and valuations including a ‘Plan of the Cairn Hill Farm, the property of Mr. Robert Best' surveyed by M. Wardhaugh in 1846, and papers concerning the Nevin, Cousins, Turtle and McDonald families who were related to the Bests through marriage.","The collection is of value to students of estate ownership and management in the nineteenth century and, in particular, with regard to the purchase of land by tenants at the end of the century.

Of particular note are those relating to General Sir Arthur Brooke (d. 1842), a commander in the British attack on Washington in 1814, and the 1st Viscount Brookeborough, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, 1943-63.","The Brookeborough papers comprise c.3,500 documents, c.115 volumes and 6 outsize photographs and formal documents, 1575, 1639 and 1658-c.1975.

Comprising some 300 documents, volumes, photographs and newspaper cuttings, the collection provides an interesting insight into the life and career of the man who was to play a critical and integral role in the evolution of Northern Ireland as a separate political entity. Items of particular note include a series of personal letters and diaries, 1900-1902, relating Craig’s experiences of the Boer War in South Africa, where he served under the banner of the Royal Irish Rifles; an exceptionally good run of 59 volumes of press cuttings, 1903-1941, which are valuable not just as a record of Craigavon’s life and evolving political career (he first secured parliamentary success in 1906), but as source material for one of the most important periods in Irish history, that of Ulster Unionist opposition to Home Rule, the establishment of Northern Ireland etc. As regards the Ulster Volunteer Force there are typescript copies of descriptions by Capt. Agnew and Col. Fred Crawford of the famous gun-running at Larne in 1914.  Much of the material in the collection, however, emanates from Lady Craigavon such as a memorandum written by her about her husband's crucial visit to meet Eamon De Valera in Dublin in May 1921. There are also typescript copies of portions of her diaries, 1883-1900 and 1905-1940, important in documenting the important role played by women in rallying support for Unionism particularly after the extension of the franchise to women over thirty in 1918. Other items in the collection include: photograph albums of family and official visitors, 1920-1940, and of cruises taken by the Craigavons, 1905-1914; numerous programmes and booklets relating to the Unionist campaign against Home Rule; visitors' books of the various Craig homes which include records of landmarks in Ulster history such as the signatures of all the notable guests assembled for the signing of the Ulster Covenant on 28 September 1912.  It is important to note that the Craigavon Papers do not contain any political correspondence. However, the researcher should be made aware that the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland holds a highly significant number of political papers of Viscount Craigavon under the reference number T/3775.","A particular strength of the Craigavon Papers is the documentation and information which they provide about the Home Rule issue and the background to, and formation of, Northern Ireland. Further, as the papers of one of the principal founders of the new state and its first Prime Minister, their significance is self-evident.","The Craigavon Papers consist of c.230 individual documents and c.60 volumes (largely consisting of newspaper cuttings and photograph albums), 1884-1940.",Collection.

45,Craigavon Political Papers,T/3775,,"Political correspondence of Sir James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon, statesman and first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (1871-1940), 1907-1953. James Craig trained as a stockbroker in Belfast and fought in the Boer War before he entered politics becoming Unionist MP for East Down in 1906. Although his skills were recognised at Westminster where he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and the Admiralty 1919-1921, he is best remembered for his leading role in the bitter struggle against Irish Home Rule after 1910 when, as the chief lieutenant of Sir Edward Carson he organised the means of resistance. Despite the intervention of the 1914-1918 war, the Government of Ireland Act was eventually passed in December 1920 and Craig, a baronet since 1918, became the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. After the 'treaty' of December 1921 which led to the 'opting out' of Northern Ireland, a great deal of difficulty and instability for Craig followed in the form of rampant lawlessness and the boycotting by nationalists of the new institutions. For nineteen years, until his death in 1940, Craig, raised to the peerage as Viscount Craigavon of Stormont in 1927, remained Prime Minister. and gradually steered the small ship of state into calmer waters, introducing important leglistation in the fields of housing, education, industry and agriculture.   Craigavon's political papers are full of important documentation and information relating to the turbulent period in Irish history in the early decades of the twentieth century. They represent a very significant complement to the other Craigavon Papers in  PRONI's custody (ref. D/1415) which do not contain any letters of a political nature. Amongst the most important are 28 letters, 1911-33, from Sir Edward Carson, discussing practical arrangements and political developments during the years of opposition to Home Rule and the early years of the Northern Ireland state. There is also much correspondence around the period 1912-1914 from  leading English figures and Conservative lights such as the Duke of Devonshire, Lords Salisbury, Selborne, Charles Beresford and Hugh Cecil. Other letters are from a Belgian diplomat called E. de Carier de Marchienne and Lord Kitchener about the sale of UVF guns to Belgium.  The views and role of the monarchy during the Irish crisis are also represented in the papers. There are letters from King George V and his private secretary, Lord Stamfordham, including a 4-page typed memorandum by Craig of his private conversation with the King after the breakdown of the Buckingham Palace Conference on 24 July 1914 and a 'Private and confidential' letter from Stanfordham to Craig, 17 September 1924. Another important correspondent was David Lloyd George who wrote to Craig on a number of occasions between 1917 and 1921; he also invited Craig and De Valera to a conference in London to find a settlement, 24 June 1921. For this same crucial period, 1921-1922, there are 'personal and secret' letters to Craig from Sir Hamar Greenwood, Chief  Secretary for Ireland, pertaining to: a secret meeting between Craig and De Valera about terrorist outrages; papers about Craig's various meetings with De Valera, May-June 1921, and his subsequent agreement with Michael Collins in January 1922, including the original of that agreement.  The correspondence continues through the 1920s and 1930s. There are 8 letters, 1924-1940, from Neville Chamberlain about issues such as Craigavon's proposal that Britain should invade the Irish Free State in June 1940. Other correspondents included the Irish Prime Minister, W.T. Cosgrave, Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and the 2nd and 3rd Dukes of Abercorn. Also there is a letter from Stanley Baldwin paying tribute to the recently deceased Craigavon in 1940.","The collection is particularly strong because of the important correspondence it contains emanating from the leading political figures of the day during one of the most significant periods of Irish political history.

46,Charlotte Despard Papers,D/2479,,"Papers of Charlotte Despard, née French (1844-1939), suffragette, pacifist, Irish republican and socialist, c. 1900-1935.   An active, if at times, extreme exponent of the causes she adopted, Charlotte Despard is a significant figure in the history of early 20th century Britain and Ireland, renowned for the leading role she played in the suffragette movement. Born in Kent in 1844 of Protestant Anglo-Irish descent, she became politically active from 1890 onwards when, on the death of her husband, Maxillian Despard, she decided to dedicate her life to helping the poor, joining and supporting various organisations including that of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). She later moved to Dublin in 1916 and became an active supporter of Sinn Fein and member of the Friends of Soviet Russia. Her radicalism, however, in this quarter, won her few friends and, under the government of the Irish Free State, was eventually banned as a subversive. In 1933, she moved to Belfast, where she died in 1939.   This collection of her papers contains a range of revealing material. Of particular note are a series of personal diaries dating from 1913-26 in which Despard comments on the suffragette movement, and the pacifist, Irish republican and socialist causes of the time. Apart from these main themes the diaries cover areas and events such as: her meeting with Ghandi in London in 1914; her journalistic activities; the formation of the League of Nations; penal reform; her travels in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 1913. There is also correspondence, 1928-c.1935, concerning family affairs and her activities in support of socialism. Other items include: printed pamphlets and papers, 1908-35, including copies of 'The Women's Freedom League', 'Women's World Committee against war and fascism', ' The Friends of Soviet Russia', and a hymn sheet for the funeral service of Mrs. Pankhurst, 1928; manuscript novels and novelettes together with a number of  poems and songs written by Mrs. Despard, c.1900.","The Despard diaries are an important tool for students of the suffragette movement and, to a lesser degree, pacificism, Irish republicanism and socialism in the early part of the twentieth century.","The Charlotte Despard Papers consist of c.150 items, c.1900-35.

47,Dobbs Papers,D/162,,"c.160 letters, petitions, notebooks, diaries, pamphlets and other documents, c.1568-1917, principally of Arthur Dobbs (1689-1765), governor of North Carolina, 1754-1765, and well-known eighteenth century Irish author and statesman. Dobbs was high sheriff of Antrim in 1720 and in 1727 was returned for Carrickfergus in the Irish Parliament of 1727-30. He was appointed engineer-in-chief and surveyor-general in Ireland. He had a lifelong interest in America and, in 1754, was appointed governor of North Carolina where he adopted a conciliatory policy with the Indian tribes.   The main interest of the collection is Canadian. Of prime importance is the earliest volume called 'Henry Kelsey, his Book; being the gift of James Hubbud in the year of our Lord 1693'. It covers the life of an officer of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1683 to 1722. There is also an anonymous diary (about 8,000 words in length) apparently kept by an officer of Major-General James Wolfe's (1727-59) staff and relating to the Quebec campaign. It commences on June 27th, 1759, with the landing at the St Lawrence River, and closes with the fall of Quebec giving a vivid account of Wolfe's death. Other Canadian and North American related material includes a number of letters concerned with Dobbs' dispensation of his patronage in Canada, letters focussing on the role of the Hudson's Bay Company and manuscript notebooks pertaining to the Quebec campaign of the Seven Years' War, 1754-65. Dobbs was particularly interested in increasing commerce between Britain and Ireland and America and he corresponded on this subject with senior figures in the British administration, including Sir Robert Walpole and the 1st Earl Granville, 1727-31.  Other notable items to be found within the collection includes a 90 page manuscript volume, c.1568-c.1689, containing information about Carrickfergus Corporation, and a bound manuscript copy of a translation of the Carrickfergus charter, 14 Dec. 1612, a rental of Carrickfergus, 1680 and a Council Order, 1 Feb. 1637. In relation to the 1798 Rebellion of the United Irishmen, there is a list of officers and men serving in the rebel army and depositions, 1798, taken at Newtownards and Saintfield against various persons alleged to have been at the battles of Antrim and Ballynahinch. There is a statistical account of the Parish of Carrickfergus for 1822 which is full of valuable information about the area and various leases and title deeds, 1739-1917. The rent roll of Viscount Dungannon's Estate for 1768 gives some interesting particulars as to the tenants in the district lying between Holywood and the vicinity of Shaw's Bridge, Co. Down.",The collection is an important research tool for those interested in the early development of Canada and trade between the British Isles and North America.,"Approx. 160 items, c.1568-1917, comprising a range of documents, volumes, diaries, title deeds etc. and occupying five PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and cannot be inspected personally in order to protect the long term preservation of the records.

Some of the earlier documents exist as late seventeenth century or early eighteenth century copies. Valuable documentation relating to the administration of diocesan lands and related issues includes: the surrender of lands belonging to the See of Derry from George Montgomery, Bishop of Derry, Raphoe and Clogher to James 1, August 1610; list of 'Glebes to be allotted to the several parishes in the Barony of Loughinsolin', c.1630; 'Grant of Glebes to various parishes in Diocese of Derry', 24 May 1626; King's letter, 20 Nov. 1629, for issue of Letters Patent for creation of Dean and Chapter of St. Columb's, Derry; note c.1620, concerning the payment of tithes by corn mills on the estates of the See of Derry. One of the chief interests of the collection lies in the wealth of material available for seventeenth and eighteenth century disputes.

49,Papers of Professor Charles Ryle Fay,D/1571,,"Papers of Professor Charles Ryle Fay (1884-1961), Reader in Economic History at Cambridge University and formerly of the University of Toronto, Ontario. Comprising mainly correspondence, transcripts, research and other working notes, the collection bears witness to Professor Fay’s academic interests in the economic history of 19th Century England, and in particular, to English relations with Newfoundland and on such influential individuals as Adam Smith (1723-1790), Edmund Burke (1729-1797) and William Huskisson (1770-1830). Included can be found a mass of material concerning Newfoundland and Labrador including a war office volume of 1792 from St John's, Newfoundland, on trade and fisheries and notes detailing the actions of Sir Hugh Pallister, Governor of Newfoundland, 1762-66. There are also personal letters of Professor Fay relating to Newfoundland and various articles on the history of the Canadian National Railway Company in Newfoundland, 1952-3. Other material includes: notes pertaining to the changes in the development and management of the Newfoundland seal fishery based firm, Job Brothers & Co., 1944-53; transcript notes ''The economy of the modern fishery"" detailing research in Newfoundland in the 1950s. Fay's other working papers contain: detailed background notes relating to William Huskisson and treaty-making for the period, 1786-1830 including transcripts of letters addressed to William Pitt; papers and notes on the commercial treaties between Britain and Latin America, 1825 to 1834; notes based on manuscripts from the Auckland Papers containing correspondence addressed to Lord Auckland, 1768-1827. There is a handwritten notebook, 1932-41, detailing factory life in Spitalfields in the early part of the 19th century including sections on agriculture, industry and regulations; another relates to the Old Board of Trade and its duty to expand commercial policy in the late 18th century - it includes sections on the proceedings of the Grains Committee, 1868-78, and on the 1828 Lords Committee reports on the game laws.",The principal strength lies in the wide and varied range of the working papers assembled by Professor Fay.,"c.1,000 items, c.1930-c.1960, comprising a range of volumes and documents and occupying 22 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and the greater part of it which is catalogued can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

50,John Galt's Diary,D/561,,"Personal diary of John Galt (1767-1837), general merchant and missionary, of Coleraine, Co. Londonderry, covering the period 1796 to 1837. His diary is written in five quarto books bound together into one volume, but there is a gap between the years 1803 and 1817. The entries are usually made at intervals of a week or ten days and are largely of a devotional character reflecting Galt's religious pre-occupations. His main interest was in Methodism, particularly its missionary side. He gives some details of the beginnings of Methodism in Coleraine and district and also records some preaching tours of his own, not only in his own province but in Leinster and Connaught as well. Galt also comments on some of the events and tendencies of the 1790s: the United Irishmen's Movement, the execution of William Orr, the Battle of Antrim and other engagements. He seems to have served as a local volunteer with a body of troops commanded by Lord Henry Murray and to have taken part in some engagement between the royal forces and the rebels advancing on Coleraine from Ballymoney, but his details are very vague. Two rebel leaders were later executed at Coleraine. He also notes bad seasons, scarcity of provisions and their effect on the poor. Galt's business activities as a general merchant in Coleraine are also highlighted in the diary until 1827 when the business failed. After selling his property to meet the demands of his creditors, Galt retired to a cottage in Portstewart. In 1832 there was an outbreak of cholera which in September reached Coleraine. Galt states that there were about 260 cases there and the deaths about 110. On 25 November of that year, Galt, now in Portstewart, wrote: 'We have been busily engaged this week in settling our cholera accounts, Government advanced money to erect hospitals, lay in medicines, apparatuses, etc., to be repaid again by instalments. We had everything of that kind with a doctor (Dr. Lever) engaged at sixty pounds a year with a proper board of health and other officers appointed to meet the disease, but though only 3 miles from Coleraine where it raged with much violence, and hourly communications betwixt the two places, there never has been a single case hereh in Portstewart'.

51,Greer Papers ,D/1044,,"Correspondence of the Greer family of Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, 1717-1896. Operating from New Hamborough in Dungannon, where the family owned a bleach green, the Greers’ were an important and influential linen family in the North of Ireland during the 18th and 19th centuries. Written mainly to the three Thomas Greers from 1717 to 1891, the letters contained in this collection provide a detailed account of the Family’s business activities and an interesting case study for the history and development of the linen trade in Ulster. Letters to and from the second Thomas Greer (1724-1803) form the bulk of the collection. These principally deal with business affairs, and, in particular, the linen trade with England and America. His contacts included Wakefield, Willet & Miers (later Wakefield, Pratt and Miers) in London and Samuel & John Morton in Philadelphia. Difficulties with trade are highlighted throughout, particularly for the period leading up to and during the American War of Independence (1770-1783), which led to a cessation of trade between America and Europe for some time after 1774. Outside their business activities, the Greer family were Quakers and made religious visits to England and Scotland as well as all over Ireland. There are a number of religious letters to be found within the collection, usually referred to as Devotional, as well as a section containing miscellaneous documents concerning religous matters describing in detail religious disputes within the Quaker movement.","This is an extremely important collection of letters revealing and documenting much about the history of linen in Ireland in the 18th and 19th centuries, and providing a detailed and interesting story of an important linen family..","c. 1,000 letters and a small number of volumes, 1717-1896, occupying three PRONI boxes.",Collection.

52,Groves Collection,T/808,,"c. 20,000 copies of genealogical working papers and abstracts of miscellaneous documents, c.1650-1920, compiled and copied by Tenison E. Groves, a professional genealogist and antiquarian who worked at the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin from around 1900 until after the Four Courts Fire of 1922. The genealogical material has been arranged roughly by surname in small volumes, some of which relate to one name only, some to a group of related families, others to several surnames starting with the same letter. The arrangement of the material is variable, alphabetisation has not been adhered to, not all variant spellings have been noted, place names are difficult to trace. The great importance of this archive is that it contains extracts from documents which were destroyed in the Irish Civil War in 1922. It is particularly rich in will abstracts which appear in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland index to pre-1858 wills and extracts from legal proceedings, principally during the 17th and 18th centuries, which contain genealogical material and relate mainly to the gentry and merchant families, though there is a surprising amount relating to minor 19th century families including many extracts from the censuses of 1821-51. A further collection of Tenison Groves' papers is in the National Archives, Dublin, and there is considerable overlap between the two collections.","Genealogically, the collection is invaluable particularly as a replacement for the vast quantities of records lost in the Four Courts Fire of 1922.","c.20,000 documents and small volumes comprising copies and abstracts of original papers dating from c.1650-1920, reproduced between c.1900 and 1922 and occupying c.27 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

A fairly substantial collection, the archive contains a broad range of material reflecting the life, career and interests of one of Ulster’s most prolific writers and cultural authorities. Included are: c.115 personal, official and legal papers of John and Roberta Hewitt, 1904-1987; c.390 literary, autobiographical and miscellaneous papers, 1928-1987, including 37 diaries and travel notebooks, 1934-1987, and three scrapbooks, 1928-1970; c.1050 letters, 1930-1987, between John Hewitt and notable friends, professional colleagues and publishers; c.100 letters and papers of Roberta Hewitt, 1921-1975; c.2430 miscellaneous letters, mostly to John Hewitt, 1929-1987; and c.290 theatre programmes, 1930-1982. Of particular note are the series of correspondences to be found in the collection. Included are letters from poets such as Gordon Bottomley, Austin Clarke, Séamus Heaney and W. R. Rodgers, which discuss trends in the writing of poetry, the Ulster painter, John Luke and the Irish Folklorist, Michael J. Murphy. There is also a voluminous correspondence from David Burleigh, a young friend and poet, for whom Hewitt acted as referee. In particular, there are dozens of letters written by Burleigh from Japan, where he taught English as a foreign language. Perhaps most interesting of all is the correspondence between Hewitt and Robert Patrick Maybin, who he first met during his time at Queen's University, through the poetry circle there. During the Second World War Maybin, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps, wrote to Hewitt from West Africa and Italy about poetry and about his experiences in these countries. Other papers of interest include Hewitt’s notebooks, which contain accounts of his various educational holidays in Europe, in particular to the countries of the Communist Eastern Block, which, because of his own socialist sympathies, he was drawn. Finally, the papers of Roberta (‘Ruby’) Hewitt also deserve mention. These contain letters from British MPs, miscellaneous correspondence to and from friends, relatives, employers etc and papers relating to her association with Edenderry Nursery School that she helped to found in 1938 and the Labour movement, within which she was particularly active from c 1957 to her death in 1975.","The John Hewitt Archive should have a broad appeal to students of Anglo-Irish literature and drama, and, in particular, to students interested in the development and analysis of Ulster Poetry. The collection is also notable for its valuable series of correspondence with leading figures within Ulster's cultural circles and for reflecting a side of life in Northern Ireland not normally celebrated. Hewitt's travel journals also provide a valuable commentary on life behind the Iron Curtain in such countries as Russia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and East Germany.","The collection includes approximately 4,500 documents and volumes.",Collection.Archive.Text,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accomodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

55,Records of the Irish Encumbered Estates,D/1201,,"Records of the Irish Encumbered Estates, 1849-1858. The Encumbered Estates Acts of 1848 and 1849 allowed the sale of Irish estates which had been mortgaged and whose owners, because of the savage effects of the Great Famine, were unable to meet their obligations. It was intended that English investors would be attracted to buy Irish estates and thereby give the stagnant Irish agriculture new life and prosperity. However, the 1848 Act proved abortive and had to be amended, along lines suggested by Sir Robert Peel in 1849. This measure, by the Statute 12 & 13 Vict. c.77, appointed Encumbered Estates Commissioners to authorise sales for the purpose of discharging encumbrances on land, and to give the purchaser an indefeasible title. This jurisdiction was transferred to the Landed Estates Court in 1858 by the Statute 21 & 22 Vict. c. 72. The records to be found within the collection consist of rentals and sale particulars relating to the whole of Ireland for the duration of the Irish Encumbered Estates scheme.

56,Johnston of Ballykilbeg Papers,D/880,,"Personal and political papers of William Johnston, M.P. (1829-1902), the prominent Orangeman of Ballykilbeg, Co. Down, and also of several members of his family, 1847- 1902. Born in 1829 and educated at Trinity College Dublin, William Johnston was the eldest son of John Brett Johnston and his wife Thomasina Anne of Ballykilbeg near Downpatrick. Originally intended for the medical profession, Johnston instead made his career in politics, devoting his significant energies to the Orange Order which he had joined in 1848 and was a prominent member for most of his life later becoming Deputy Grand Master of Ireland and Sovereign Grand Master of the Black Institution which was founded on his proposal in 1865. Publishing widely in support of the organisation from 1853 in various tracts, novels and newspapers, and as an Independent Conservative MP for Belfast from 1868-72 and 1878-1902, Johnston was the most important figure in Orangeism during the 19th Century. Of his political triumphs, the repeal of the 1850 Party Processions Act of 1850 in 1872 is counted amongst his chief successes. He also held the position of Inspector of Fisheries from 1872 until he was dismissed in 1885 for his verbal attacks on supporters of Home Rule and the Land League. These and other events and details of his life are fully documented throughout the archive which includes 32 of his diaries, 1847-1902; envelopes of his personal, political and Orange Order related correspondence and literature, 1841-1902; and many of his speeches in pamphlet format. Johnston's many outside interests and skills are also represented in the collection in the form of copies of songs and novels written by him between 1849 and 1863. Copies of the 'Ballykilbeg Newspaper' which he was largely responsible for are also to be found. These include articles and features on a range of topics such as horticulture, poetry, the weather, local and national news, etc., and date from 1844-49. The collection also contains a large number of title deeds, leases, testamentary papers, rentals and estate accounts pertaining to Johnston property at Ballykilbeg and Downpatrick, Co. Down, 1739-c.1900. A selection of Johnston family photographs dating from the 1880s and 1890s are also contained.",The importance of the collection lies in the information it provides about the Orange Order and Irish political history in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

58,John Martin Diary and Journal,D/560,,"Diary of the Young Irelander, John Martin (1812-1875) prior to transportation to Van Dieman's Land (Tasmania), Oct-Nov.,1848 and containing a journal of his voyage from Ireland on the convict ship 'Mountstuart Elphinstone' to Australia,1849-1850. Born in Loughorne, near Newry, County Down, John Martin was a leading Irish Nationalist during the 19th Century. A medical graduate of Trinity College Dublin, Martin joined the Young Ireland movement, which grew out of Daniel O'Connell's campaign for Repeal of the Act of Union, after travelling abroad. He became a leading contributor to John Mitchel's ""United Irishman"" and took a prominent part in the meetings of the Irish Confederation which was formed in 1847 when the group eventually split from O'Connell's Repeal Association. Following the failure of Mitchel’s Young Ireland rebellion in 1848, Martin was found guilty of sedition for publishing ""The Irish Felon"" (as a successor to the ""United Irishman"") and was sentenced to transportation for 10 years. In 1858 he was pardoned and, after spending some time in Paris, described in parts 5 and 6 of the journal, he returned to Ireland and continued to play a large part in nationalist political life, becoming MP for Meath in 1871. He married in 1868 Henrietta, daughter of the Rev. John Mitchel, Presbyterian minister at Newry, and sister of John Mitchel.","Content, range and detail from the pen of one of the leading Irish Nationalists of the 19th century render it a major source for students of Irish political history.","The Martin items consist of six parts, written on notepaper and school-exercise books covering nearly 145 pages and varying in size from roughly 7 ins by 4 ins to 9 ins by 7 ins.

59,McCance Collection,"D/272, MIC/575",,"c.150 documents, 1689-1799, comprising the records of the McCance family, and, in particular, of Captain S. McCance of London, presumably for use in his ""History of the Royal Muster Fusiliers"" (1927). This body of original documents and transcripts has strong military associations relating mostly to the 1798 period in Ulster, and including a remarkable register called 'The Black Book of the North of Ireland' which contains some 200 names of local leaders of the Society of the United Irishmen, often with particulars of their appearances and their careers in the Society. There are many lists of prisoners in northern jails such as those confined at Belfast and Carrickfergus and on board the Postlethwaite Prison Ship in Belfast Lough. There is a copy of a petition from the Belfast prisoners, a contemporary sketch of the ground over which the Battle of Ballynahinch was fought and an actual letter from a rebel in arms. The transcripts in the collection are copies made in the Public Record Office of Ireland from the military records of the years 1689 to 1719 with special reference to Brigadier Richard Ingoldsby, Colonel Herbert and the regiments associated with those officers as well as the Purcell and Sabine regiments. There is a very long set of lists of persons having claims on  regiments such as Herbert's for goods supplied or for accommodation. Also included are some interesting extracts from the Nugent Manuscripts in the Royal United Service Institution, London, comprising: lists of troops then stationed in the Northern District of Ireland, 1796; a list of the Yeomanry Corps; instructions to General Lake for disarming the North, 3 March 1797; a resolution passed at a meeting of the Orange Association at Blaris Barracks concerning strife and religious differences; a letter from Lord Castlereagh to Major General Nugent, Armagh, 3 March 1799, initiating martial law in the Northern District.",The collection is very significant for students of the 1798 Rebellion.,"c.150 items, 1689-1799, comprising predominantly documents with a small number of printed notices, maps and volumes occupying one PRONI box.",Collection.Archive.Text.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and for preservation reasons can only be examined by the medium of microfilm (ref.

The collection includes much material reflecting Midgley’s career in the Northern Ireland Labour Party and in the Stormont Government and his interests more generally. Included can be found detailed correspondence, 1929-57, relating to his political career and from such figures as former NI Prime Minister, Basil Brooke (1888-1973) and George Simpson, Secretary of the North Derry Labour Party. The correspondence also includes a strong sporting element reflecting Midgely's role as a member of the management committee of Linfield Football Club from the early 1930s (see also PRONI references D/3852 and T/3824) and later as Club Chairman, a position he held until his death in 1957. In addition, the archive also contains an important series of Midgely's diaries dating from 1928 to 1943 pertaining to issues such as the resignation of the Labour Government in Britain on 24 August, 1931. There is also a wide range of Midgely's speeches in the collection, 1940-56, covering many of the important issues of the day. Printed election material, 1923-57, press cuttings, 1929-87, a small batch of photographs, 1917-53, and 24 of his poems written between 1916 and 1954 are also to be found.",The Midgely Papers are a rich source for students of twentieth century Ulster politics.,"The Midgley Papers consist of c.2,000 documents, consisting of correspondence, diaries, photographs, printed material and press cuttings etc and comprise the contents of 5 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accomodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using  an in-house document ordering system.

61,Pinkerton Papers,D/1078,,"Collection of original papers relating to the Pinkerton family, tenant farmers from Seacon More, Co. Antrim, 1795-1921. One section of the collection deals largely with family and estate matters and includes: a 1795 lease 'to John Pinkerton, the elder, Secinmore'; various Pinkerton wills including that of Samuel Pinkerton, Senior, Secon 1811; an account book, 1870-1908, relating to the Pinkerton property; photographs of members of the Pinkerton family and other individuals, c.1860- c.1914.<br><br>The main interest of the archive, however, lies in the papers and correspondence of John Pinkerton (1830-1908) who was M.P.for Galway, 1886-1900. Pinkerton rose to local prominence as a member of the Ballymoney Debating and Agricultural Societies, and as a radically minded member of the Coleraine Board of Guardians. In 1885 he stood as an Independent candidate for North West Antrim, where despite defeat, he so impressed the Parnellites that he, a Protestant tenant farmer, was adopted as the party candidate for Galway in 1886. During his career as an M.P. he appears to have been an exceptionally active 'political missionary', and was frequently called upon to speak in favour of Land Reform and Home Rule at Liberal demonstrations throughout Scotland and England. His papers reflect his prominence in all these areas and include correspondence relating to the Ballymoney Agricultural Society, 1876-78 and his role as a member of Coleraine Board of Guardians. Above all, though, his active and significant role in politics is displayed in the papers. Many political issues are covered including: Pinkerton's work towards a Bill for the temporary relief of agricultural tenants in Ireland and the admission of certain leaseholders to the Land Act of 1881'; various election campaigns; and the appointment of a Catholic President for Queen's College, Belfast in 1900.<br><br>Of much added and important interest is the inclusion in the Pinkerton collection of 13 letters of the famous Irish Nationalist, John Mitchel, 1815-75. In his first letter, 1834, he writes to his father of his dissatisfaction with his post as a bank clerk in Londonderry. The remaining letters, 1848-74, are all written to his sister, Matilda Dixon, in Dromore, Co. Down, from his exile in Bermuda, Tennessee, Washington D.C. and Paris; the American letters are of particular interest in that they reflect Mitchel's sympathy with the South and with Southern institutions during the pre-Civil War period. He did, indeed, at this time, 1854, set up and run a newspaper in New York called the 'Citizen' which strenuously opposed the abolition movement. In one letter, written to his sister on 10 April, 1859, he declared 'I am saving the South with all my might  - indeed so violently that a great part of the south (besides the whole north) think me mad '.",The papers are particularly useful for students of Irish political history during the latter half of the nineteenth century.,"c.150 items comprising a range of documents, volumes, newspapers, printed pamphlets and photographs occupying the space of five PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text.Image.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

Containing approx. 1150 documents, the Plunket Papers are a significant collection of patents, title deeds, leases, rentals, maps, correspondence, Irish Land Commission sale papers etc concerning the family’s lands in counties Louth, Monaghan, Cork, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and, in a few cases, to the careers of the Rt. Hon William Conyngham Plunket (1764-1854), 1st Lord Plunket, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and of Rev. Thomas Span Plunket (1792-1862), 2nd Lord Plunket, Bishop of Tuam.  The papers include title deeds and leases, 1753-1919, relating to the Co. Louth estate of the Plunket family, inherited from the Foster family of Milestown, Co. Louth, which were an eventual consequence of the marriage of the Rev. Thomas Plunket and Louisa Foster in 1819. There is also a considerably smaller quantity of title deeds, leases and rent books relating to the family's  Co. Monaghan estate. This includes material concerning the Raw and Milltown estates acquired by Dr Patrick Plunket M.D by 1802 and 1809 respectively. The rent books relate to both these areas and cover the years 1838-40 and 1844; they also relate to the Plunket estate in Co. Cork, comprising the village of Newtown and the lands of Newtown, Shananagh, Kilmagoura and Clonleigh, barony of Orrery and Kilmore. The map material, 1833, 1840, 1856 and 1881-c.1930, consists of maps of various parts of the Louth estate, a map of the Raw estate, Co. Monaghan, and two maps of premises in the town of Tuam, Co. Galway; and there are voluminous Irish Land Commission (ILC) and related papers, late 19th-early 20th century, concerning the estates in both Louth and Monaghan. Wills and testamentary papers covering the period 1854-60 are also to be found. The non-estate material consists of formal documents, 1828-1829 and 1834-1835, pertaining to the legal career of the 1st Lord Plunket, including a patent granting him a pension of £4,000 a year, 1834, and a patent appointing him Lord Chancellor of Ireland, 1835; and formal documents concerning the ecclesiastical career of the 2nd Lord Plunket including his elevation to the united bishopric, 1839.","The Plunket Papers are a significant resource for subjects relating to, and associated with estate management and land purchase in Ireland from the early modern period onwards and for the development and evolution of the Plunket Family lands and property in Cos.

In 1887 Samuel Alexander Bill, a 23 year-old Belfast builder, responded to a call from chiefs of the Ibuna tribe in the Qua Iboe region of Southern Nigeria for a Christian teacher. He established a house and school and from these grew the Qua Iboe Mission which (in the 1940s) had 14 central and 700 outstations with 50 European workers and 650 native helpers, bible and evangelist colleges, training institutes for young people and a hospital.  The papers of the mission are a rich source for students of the history of misionary work in Africa. There is detailed correspondence about the work and development of the mission from 1888 to 1942, including a large section of 725 letters, 1900-42, from the Superintendent in the field, Samuel Bill, to Mr R.L. McKeown (himself a missionary in the field 1899-1901) as General Secretary of the mission in Belfast. These letters contain details of every aspect of the work. Also of considerable interest are the diaries of Samuel Bill, 1887-1941, and his loose leaf daily journals, 1902-22, which are very detailed because of his desire to keep the Home Council informed about the progress of the work. The earliest diary, Sept.-Oct. 1897, is an original daily account of the initial voyage to Qua Iboe via Old Calabar. Other contents of the archive include: bound volumes of the Mission quarterlies, 1892-1962; Annual Reports of the Belfast Qua Iboe Missionary Association (including financial reports), 1889-1941; minute books, records of donations, financial statements, etc. of the Mountpottinger and Londonderry auxiliaries of the Central Council, 1896-1960, which were established for fundraising and spreading information. There are also a range of photographs pertaining to the mission , c.1890-1940, including one of Samuel Bill and his family taken in 1896.",The collection is a major source for research into missionary work in West Africa from the 1890s onwards.

64,Registry of Deeds archive,MIC/7; MIC/311,,"2,477 microfilm reels comprising the records of the Irish Registry of Deeds,1708-1929. The Irish Registry of Deeds was founded in 1708 in Dublin, and was responsible 'for the Public Registering of all Deeds, Conveyances and Wills, that shall be made of any Honours, Manors, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments including the written wills from the time the devisor or testatrix shall die after the said 25th March, 1708'. However, the registration of deeds was not compulsory, and these transactions constitute only a  part (although a very important proportion historically for the four provinces of Ireland) of the property transactions which took place throughout the country.   One of the main functions of the Registry of Deeds was to ensure the enforcement of legislation which prevented Roman Catholics from buying or taking long leases on land. Up until the1780s, Roman Catholics could not take out a mortgage, or take leases on land for a period longer than thirty one years. As a result, the majority of the records relate to the property-owning members of the Church of Ireland. The quantity of deeds registered varies from county to county. For example, Co. Tyrone is especially well represented in registered items, while many small landowners in Co. Down and Co. Armagh tended to avoid registration. Moreover, certain religious denominations such as the Quakers and the Ulster Presbyterians tended to steer clear of registered deeds. Within these limitations, the Registry of Deeds is still an invaluable source, particularly for the eighteenth century, because a very wide range of documents was registered. Nor was Irish registration confined to the major categories of deeds, as it included details of lease, mortgage,  conveyance and annuities, rents, rights of way, wills, dissolution of partnerships, etc.  The records of the Registry of Deeds themselves comprise memorials of deeds put forward for registration. These usually contain complete copies or fairly full abstracts of the orginal documents and can be found under PRONI reference MIC/311 alongside accompanying transcript books containing a duplicative record of the above. Associated indices for Names of Grantors and Land are also available under reference MIC/7.","This is a key archive for students of estate ownership and management throughout Ireland from the beginning of the eighteenth century.,","2,477 reels of microfilm occupying the space of 133 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

The Courts Martial Book contains summaries of the evidence, etc., at courts-martial of non-commissioned officers and men of the Downshire regiment. The other three contain copies of circulars and letters to and from officers at headquarters in Dublin and elsewhere, as well as reports of courts-martial of commissioned officers in militia regiments and in line regiments at home and abroad. In the volume for 1793-6, a portion of which is missing, there are recorded 228 courts-martial. There are a few instances of something like an under court-martial, or Court of Enquiry, composed of non-commissioned officers and men, trying a private.  The reactions at home to the Napoleonic War, then in progress, are reflected in these volumes. Bounties were given to militia soldiers enlisting in line regiments for 'service in Europe only', while strenuous efforts were made to keep the militia regiments at full strength for home defence. In 1801, the Downshire Regiment, among others, volunteered to serve in England and received the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief. Bad harvests in 1799 and 1800 led to the issue of orders permitting the employment of militiamen to assist farmers in digging potatoes. But the action of several corps in intercepting potatoes on the way to market caused a shortage in Dublin. Other references to current events include a mutiny at Gibraltar in 1803, the Battle of Copenhagen, 1807, and trouble at Kilrea, Co. Londonderry in 1811 arising out of a militia soldier's 'unwarrantable language to an Orangeman'","Although quite a small collection, the volumes contain a wealth of information about the militia, not only relating to the Downshire regiment but to regiments throughout Ireland and events abroad.","4 volumes and c.20 documents, 1793-1855, occupying 2 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

Professor of French Language and Romance Philology at Queen's University, Belfast, 1909-40 and, later, Unionist MP for Queen's University and Antrim, 1940-55, these papers reflect Savory’s broad range of interests and activities in both academic and political spheres.   Apart from a group of sermons by the Rev. E. Lloyd Savory (the father of Professor Savory), c.1900, the archive consists largely of correspondence, speeches, newspaper cuttings and notes,etc., sorted into 4 broad categories: political, European affairs, education and literary, and religious. Other files of political correspondence relate particularly to Home Rule, 1911-21; foreign affairs; temperance and income tax 1941-7; the effects of the German air raids on Belfast; railway services and boundaries of wards in Londonderry, 1941-57; Eire citizens working in Northern Ireland; the export of Northern Ireland produce to Great Britain; the 'B' Specials, 1952-4; the Boundary Commission and relations with the Irish Free State, 1943-56; the setting up of the Republic of Ireland, 1946-8; and the Orange Order, 1949-65. The remaining correspondence deals with Polish affairs, 1945-68 deriving partly from his assignment as special investigator into the massacre of Polish officers at Katyn Wood in 1941 (the main bulk of his Polish papers are in the Polish Institute and Sigorski Museum in London); minority disputes in the South Tyrol and in South Slesvig, 1945-64; and administrative matters in connection with Queen's University including letters commenting on the Suez crisis of 1956. There are also notes and correspondence reflecting Savory's interest in Church history, 1938-64, such as material on the history of the Moravian Church and the Waldensian Church and correspondence with the Archbishops of Armagh and Canterbury.   Another section of the archive comprises four folders containing extracts from the official reports recording speeches made and questions asked by Savory in the House of Commons, 1941-55. There is a substantive quantity of pamphlets, drafts and copies of articles, reviews and public addresses and speeches etc., most of them by Savory, 1922-67, on a wide variety of subjects including twentieth century political events, the Plantation of Ulster, the French Revolution, the Huguenots and the Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland; subject indexed newspaper cuttings, 1901-65; and a small number of photographs of Savory..","The collection is particularly strong because, given Professor Savory's long life span, there is important material relating to many aspects of Irish history covering the greater part of the 20th century. In addition, Savory's interests and role in international affairs make the collection a valuable source for various aspects of 20th century European history.","c.1,000 individually-numbered items, c.1900-69 comprising a range of c. 65 documents, 48 volumes, c. 80 folders, newspaper cuttings and 4 photographs occupying 33 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text.Image.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

67,Sharman Crawford Papers,D/856,,"Estate and political papers of the Crawford, Sharman and Sharman-Crawford families of Co. Down, c.1717-1920. Of particular significance are the papers of William Sharman-Crawford (1781-1861), MP for Dundalk, 1835-1837, and Rochdale, 1841-1852. Consisting of correspondence and memoranda, 1830-61, this section of the collection charts the development and progress of Crawford’s political career and interests. A keen supporter of Catholic Emancipation and later a federalist solution to the Irish Question, he is chiefly reknowned for his work in support of the tenant farmers of Ireland and, in particular securing the legal recognition of the Ulster custom of Tenant Right. His papers also demonstrate his radical approach to such issues as the Franchise and the Corn Laws. The papers are rich in correspondence on these and other important issues of the day. His correspondents include major figures such as Grey, Peel, Russell, Stanley, Graham, Hume, Cobden, Bright, Napier, Cardwell, Sheil, O'Connell and Smith O'Brien. There are also a large number of informative memoranda written by Sharman-Crawford on a wide range of issues such as the economic position of Ireland and, in particular, the drain on the economy (estimated at £1.5 million per annum) caused by absenteeism. The collection also includes a series of devotional memoranda reflecting Crawford’s later preoccupation (after 1852) with religion, which illustrate, for example, his reasons for withdrawing from the Established Church of Ireland in favour of Unitarianism.  The second major constituent of the collection comprises rentals, accounts, leases, maps and correspondence for the several estates which came into the hands of the Sharman-Crawford family, at Rademon, Crawfordsburn and Banbridge in Co. Down, and at Stalleen in Co. Meath. These cover the years c.1830-1900. A group of testamentary and trust papers relating to the clients of Arthur Sharman-Crawford, solicitor, includes such families as Gordon, Angerstein, Bellingham, Holmes-Houston, Adams, Forbes and Burr, c.1800-1900.","The principal strength of the collection centres on the important political correspondence included, much of it emanating from leading political figures.","c.2,500 items comprising correspondence, volumes, maps, testamentary papers, etc., occupying the space of 23 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text..,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

68,Spender Papers,"D/1295, D/715",,"Personal and political papers of Sir Wilfred Spender (1876-1960), Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, 1926-1944. Comprising correspondence, memoranda, diaries, press cuttings, and other documents, the Spender Papers are an essential resource in documenting the emergence and development of Northern Ireland as a political entity during the early 20th century.   Reflecting the various facets and interests of his career, in particular his contribution to the Ulster Unionist movement against Home Rule and the early development of the state of Northern Ireland, the collection is divided into two principal deposits. D/1295 consists of some 700 documents, c.1900-60, and falls into three groups. Firstly, there are papers relating to his retirement from the Army in 1913 which he was compelled to do after signing the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant. Secondly, there is material pertaining to his activities between 1914 and 1919 as an administrator in the Ulster Volunteer Force during the period of the organised gun-running at Larne, Co. Antrim, and papers in 1914 dealing with the organisation of the Ulster Volunteer Force and, after the outbreak of the War, with the incorporation of the UVF into the British Army. Other papers relate to his resumed military career after August 1914 with the 36th (Ulster) Division in the 1st World War and later as Staff Officer at GHQ. Thirdly, there are papers and correspondence relating to his career in Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1944. Although quite miscellaneous, these papers are important for reflecting Spender’s role as Secretary to the Northern Ireland Cabinet and concern a diverse range of topics including the Imperial Economic Conference; Civil Service estimates; the organisation of the Great Northern Railway; the composition of the Privy Council for Northern Ireland; the Ulster Special Constabulary; and the Boundary Commission. Principal correspondents also include Rt. Hon. H.M.Pollock (Minister of Finance), Sir Ernest Clark (Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service) and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Sir James Craig.   The other major constituent of the archive comprises Sir Wilfrid's diaries for the period from 1934 to 1944 during which time he was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (D/715 and MIC/559). They are twenty-four in number, and taken in conjunction with the papers described above, they give a rounded picture of a remarkable man. In particular, they provide an interesting insight into attitudes and views on the island of Ireland concerning the Second World War.","The Spender Papers and Diaries constitute a major research tool for the Home Rule crisis in particular, and also for the formative years of the Northern Ireland state.","c.750 items, c.1900-1960, comprising a range of documents, volumes, photographs and newspaper cuttings and occupying 10 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

69,Talbot/Gregory Papers,D/4100,,"Personal and political correspondence of Sir Charles Chetwynd Talbot (1777-1849), second Earl Talbot of Hensol, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, 1817-1821, and William Gregory (1762-1840), Under-Secretary in Dublin Castle, 1812-1831.   Talbot, the great-grandson of Charles Talbot, a former Lord Chancellor, first came to prominence in 1803 when he took an active part in organising a volunteer force in his home county of Staffordshire in opposition to Napoleon’s threat of invasion. He was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of that county in 1812, a position he retained until his death in 1849. He is, however, best known for his services as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Appointed in 1817, he took a particular interest in agricultural matters and, though he steadily opposed catholic emancipation, received much credit from Daniel O’Connell for his impartiality on the subject. William Gregory, on the other hand, was of a more liberal persuasion. A fluent Irish speaker, he is best remembered as one of the longest serving Under-Secretaries in Dublin Castle, holding his position from 1802 to 1831, and as a trusted adviser to successive viceroys and Chief Secretaries. Indeed, he was described by O’Connell at this time as the real ruler of Ireland. Other positions of note included Sheriff of Galway, 1799, and Secretary to the Inland Navigation Board, 1801-11.  From the correspondence, it is clear that Talbot and Gregory were close friends and that their families were also on intimate terms. The majority of the letters cover the period when Talbot was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. They concern many of the prinicipal issues and events of the time, most notably: negotiations with the 1st Viscount Sidmouth and the 2nd Earl of Liverpool (Home Secretary and Prime Minister respectively); the Catholic Question; Ribbon and other disturbances; appointments (mostly ecclesiastical); William Saurin's controversial career, including his resignation from the Attorney-Generalship in 1822; George IV's post-coronation visit of 1821; and Talbot's unexpected recall from office in December 1822 as a result of growing political discontent in Ireland. Letters written in 1821, mainly from Talbot to Gregory, discuss the withdrawal of troops from Ireland which the former was opposed to and also 'the lamentable poverty of the Irish Peasants'. A number of letters from the end of the 1820s concentrate on the important issue of Catholic Emancipation. Nine letters are to Talbot from family and other friends.",The principal strength of the collection lies in its analysis and coverage of the major issues at the beginning of the 19th century from the perspective of two of the leading political figures of the day.,"139 letters, 1819-1835, occupying 2 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

Comprising approx. 200 documents and title deeds etc, these papers chart the development and management of the estate in Antrim and Monaghan during the 19th century.

Included are c.30 family settlements, mortages, abstracts of title, etc, c.1860-1890, particularly for townlands in the parishes of Muckno, Ballybay and Clontibret, Co. Monaghan. Under PRONI reference D/988, there is a deed relating to the Templeton estate in counties Antrim and Monaghan in the nineteenth century.

71,Tithe Records,FIN/5/A,,"The tithe system, which originally earmarked one-tenth of the produce of the land (and subsequently one-tenth of income in cash) for the upkeep of the anglican clergy, was introduced into Ireland under English law. The system was unpopular and regarded as unfair and unjust as the majority of the population was Roman Catholic and a high proportion of Protestants were Presbyterian and did not conform to the Established Church. Tithes were abolished by the Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871.  The Tithe Composition Applotment records comprise 275 volumes covering the years from 1823 to 1837. Each volume deals with a single parish, the content being sub-divided by townland and recording against each townland the names of the occupiers, the areas subject to tithe, the valuation and the tithe payable. They relate primarily to the six counties which now constitute Northern Ireland but other counties (e.g. Cavan) will appear where a townland straddles the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The tithe books are unique records giving details of land occupation and valuations for individual holdings prior to the devastation wrought by the Great Famine of 1845 to 1849 and the accompanying mass emigration. For parish, townland and holding, the books give a picture of the quality of the land and the use made of it, differentiating between arable, pasture and non-productive land.The disastrous loss of historical material in the Four Courts fire of 1922 has left the tithe books as a unique genealogical source linking personal names with specific areas.  However, several difficulties are presented in the use of the tithe books: a small number of parishes were not subject to tithe because the land was of such poor quality that no tithe could be levied; church lands were tithe free; local names were not always those selected by the Ordnance Survey during its delimitation of townlands and parishes. That delimitation involved considerable changes, including the division and renaming of townlands. The shift towards administrative standardisation was pushed further by legislation in the 1830s which transferred townlands from one parish to another and even from one county to another. Finally, it should be noted that the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland holds on microfilm an index to the books (ref. MIC/15K) and also microfilm copies of the applotment books for the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan (ref. MIC/442).",The principal strength of the collection is as a unique genealogical source for the period preceeding the Great Famine.,275 volumes 1823 to 1837 occupying 72 PRONI boxes.,Collection.

72,Vaughan Charity Records,D/433,,"Records of the Vaughan Charity Charter School, Tubrid, near Kesh, Co. Fermanagh, 1776-1934. Founded under the will of George Vaughan (d. 1763) of Buncrana, Co. Donegal, the Vaughan Charity Charter School first opened in November 1787 with 30 boys; girls were later admitted in 1828. The school was managed at long range by a Board consisting mainly of  largely absentee ecclesiastics. There were problems with abscondment, discipline and health and, although there were temporary improvements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the State eventually intervened and the school was closed in 1933.  Comprising five outsize volumes, the surviving records include a complete register of the male pupils who attended the school throughout its history, from 1787 to 1933. It details such information as the name and age of pupil, the parish from which he or she came, the names of those who recommended the pupil to the charity and an observations column recording information such as the destination of the pupil on leaving. Those who made recommendations included the Marquis of Ely, Sir Arthur Brooke and the Bishop of Clogher and pupils were admitted from all over the north of Ireland.  The archive also contains a series of Governors' Minute Books, 1776-1934, which include reports received and passed from the chaplain, schoolmaster, schoolmistress and medical officer.

Down from its original acquisition in 1658 by William Waring (1619-1703), then of Derriaghy, Co. Antrim, to c. 1803.

A meticulous and careful photographer with a keen appreciation of history, William Alfred Green (1870-1958) has been described as a man before his time in recognising the importance of things, which most people preferred to ignore as being ordinary, old-fashioned or of little consequence.

Included can be found photographs showing pre-industrialised methods of linen production and workers employed in the textile mills, images of the Donegal home-spun industry and tram construction in the Sandy Row area of South Belfast alongside such local customs as the May-eve, the gathering and selling of Shamrock for St. Patrick’s Day and the unusual practices of Wedding Maskers. Green was also a life-long member of the Belfast Naturalists Field Club, to which he gave numerous talks and presentations, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland.

116,Allison Collection,D/2886,,"Photographs and business records of the photographic firm, Allison & Co., Armagh, 1889-1953.<br><br>Trading initially as Allison and Allison, the firm of Allison & Co. was originally established in Belfast in 1881 by a Bradford man, Herbert Thackwray Allison with his brother as partner. They had two offices in the Belfast area, firstly in Donegall Square North and Queen’s Arcade, Belfast, before extending outwards into Dundalk (1896), Armagh (1900), Newry (1903) and Warrenpoint (1905). In 1903 Herbert Allison junior relocated to Armagh where he remained for almost fifty years. Herbert senior moved to live in Warrenpoint about 1905, from where he ran the Newry and Warrenpoint studios. Over the years, he was a tireless worker for his adopted town serving as a J.P. and councillor and lived there until his death at the age of 94 in 1947.  It was the Armagh office, however, which became the hub of the enterprise and was generally regarded as the headquarters until it was sold to Ernest Scott in 1952. <br><br>This Armagh factor is reflected in the history and content of the archive as the Armagh studio became the final repository for the surviving glass plate negatives from all four provincial branches. Also, inevitably the greater numbers of those negatives which have survived relate to Armagh and the surrounding area but the work of the Newry, Warrenpoint and Dundalk studios is also represented. <br><br>The subjects portrayed in the collection are wide and varied and provide a deep pictorial insight into the social mores of life in Counties Armagh, Down and Louth (and to a lesser degree Counties Fermanagh, Monaghan and Londonderry) during the late nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century. They include: transport; clerical and church; architecture and buildings; medicine; sport; musical and dramatic scenes; the Orange Order; businesses and people at work; life during the World Wars I and II; portraits of individuals, families and weddings; agriculture; youth organisations. Even within the material covered by a particular subject, the nature of the photographs is wide-ranging. Interesting photographs include: Michael Collins, who had been elected as MP for Armagh in the new northern parliament, at a large Sinn Fein demonstration on 4 September 1921; the wartime wedding of the first GI bride in Armagh.  <br><br>Another interesting and important aspect of the archive is the day-books for the Armagh studio which, apart from two, Sept. 1911-Oct. 1915, have survived for posterity. Allison usually inscribed an identification number on his negatives which was cross-referenced in the day-book allowing easy access to names and dates.","One of the principal strengths of the Allison photographs is the wide thematic base which is represented for a significant part of south and south-east Ulster, particularly for the period, c.1890-c.1950. Prints are of an extremely high quality, which, with the survival of the accompanying day-books, makes this collection an invaluable source for researchers.","c.1,550 photographs (and also the coresponding negatives of the prints and the glassplate negatives) and 34 volumes, 1889-1953 occupying c.70 PRONI boxes, by far the greater part of which are the original glassplate negatives.",Collection.

118,Autographed Collection,,,"The McCready Collection, received in 1982, added many new and important volumes to a varied and extensive collection of books signed by their authors.  The significance of this collection cannot be over-stressed, representing as it does a vital link between the function of the Library and its effectiveness in the field of literary endeavour.  One of the most important autographed works in the Library is the 1796 edition of Bunting's ""Ancient Irish music"".  Its special significance being due to the fact that it is an eloquent testimony of  vision, foresight and solid achievement of  the  founders of the Society and Library.  Without Dr James McDonnell's driving force, the work of collecting the airs would not have been undertaken; and without the financial backing of the Society, they would never have been published. In this collection there are some rare and unusual items, none, perhaps, more unusual than a copy of Richard Hayward's ""This is Ireland: Ulster and the city of Belfast"", published in London in 1950 and dedicated by the author to the American singer and composer Burl Ives.  Noted writers of  the nineteenth century are represented by T. Crofton Croker, Vere Foster, James Sheridan Knowles, Alice Milligan and R. M .Young.

123,Denis Ireland Collection,,,"Denis Ireland (1894-1974) was a freelance writer and broadcaster.  The Linen Hall Library holds first editions of his published works, articles published by him, tapes of BBC interviews, photographs and collected letters.  Ireland was born in the north of Ireland, educated at Belfast Academical Institution and started to study medicine at Queen's University, Belfast before joining the Royal Irish Fusiliers in France and Greece during World War I.  He was invalided with the rank of captain.  After the war he represented his family linen firm, travelling in Britain, Canada and the United States.  Ireland changed direction again in the thirties when he decided to pursue a career devoted to writing. He worked briefly as a talks assistant with the BBC. He was described by Robert Greacen as ""something of a white blackbird, that is, an Ulster Protestant - Presbyterian in fact -with strong nationalist sympathies, a sort of throwback to the radical Presbyterians of the late eighteenth century who supported the demands of their Catholic fellow-countrymen for reform"".  His writing supports this notion. He wrote many articles, pamphlets and books espousing his political ideals.  He became a member of the Irish Senate in 1948 until 1951, being the first resident of Northern Ireland to become a member of the Oireachtas.  His works include Red Brick City, From the Irish Shore (1936), an autobiography, Patriot Adventurer (1936), a short life of Tone, The Age of Unreason (1942), and Six Counties in Search of a Nation (1947).   Died in a Belfast nursing home, 23 September 1974. In  his work Red Brick City Ireland claimed Ulster Presbyterians to be the only natural republicans in Ireland.

Although founded in 1788 with the purpose of collecting ""such materials as will illustrate the antiquities, the natural, civil, commercial and ecclesiastical history of this country"" the Linen Hall Library did not start to collect Irish material until 1893.  Before this date material relating to Ireland was interfiled with general books on those topics.  With the decision taken to actively collect in this subject area all Irish material already in the library was brought together in a special class.   Books, newspapers, periodicals, maps, prints, charts, reports, inquiries, manuscripts and pamphlets relating to all aspects of Irish civilisation form one of the most important Irish collections in the world.

He designed many bookplates, including that of the Linen Hall Library.

Badeley, Graham Johnston, Robert Gibbings and Jack B. Yeats.  The Core of this collection was donated by the photographer and natural historian Robert J. Welch.  His own bookplate was designed by J. W. Carey from a photograph he took on Clare Island, County Mayo in 1909-10, depicting the great headland of Croaghmore from the north-east.  The collection and study of bookplates has long been a recognised area of endeavour for the bibliographer, the artist, the collector and the social historian.

The collection comprises the published work of the poets of  the north of Ireland in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Little known outside their own locality, the poetic output of these men and women was until recently attributed to (and largely dismissed as ) an attempt to imitate the Scottish bard, Robert Burns.

The collection in Belfast Central Library comprises some one hundred and forty-one volumes and includes surveys, maps, wills, administrative records, manuscripts and correspondence.

The letters, written to Lady Amelia Lennox by members of her extensive family, abound with references to the leading figures of the time such as pitt, Fox, Grattan, Mrs Siddons, Walpole and Garrick. There are over sixty letters from her son Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the renowned United Irishman, and nearly one hundred letters from Lady Sarah Lennox, Amelia’s sister, who was reputedly proposed to by George the Third.

The subject range of the collection is vast, encompassing theology and philosophy; economic, social, political and military history; art and costume; travel and exploration; literature, science and medicine. The collections are key resources for a wide range of research interests, especially in the field of Irish Studies. The Fine Book Room Collection is separated from the general Belfast, Ulster and Irish Studies Departmental Collections because of the rarity of the items. Sections of note in this collection include Incunabula - a range of early printed books. This is a collection from the 15th century including Aulus Gellius ""Noctes Atticae"", printed in Venice by Nicholas Jenson, 1492 and Thomas Aquinas ""Quaestiones de duodecim quodlibet"", printed by Johann Zainer at Ulm, 1475. The Early Printed Books comprise English and continental books printed between 1501-1799.

There is also a collection of over 1,000 early Belfast printed books, including works from presses of Archer, Blew, Joy, Magee, Mairs, Simms and Smyth. A collection of the fine printed works of Marcus Ward and Company are also held. Fine editions of private presses such as Golden Cockerel and Doves Press have been acquired.

187,J.B. Armour Papers,D/1792,,"The records and papers of the Rev. J.B. Armour, Presbyterian Minister and Home Ruler, Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, 1841-1928. Consisting of a range of correspondence, press cuttings and other documents, the Armour Papers comprise an interesting collection bearing on religious, political and educational matters in late 19th and early 20th century Ulster. Religious papers comprise Armour's (sometimes controversial) sermons, details of his part in debates of the Presbyterian General Assembly and letters to his friend, John Megaw J.P., also of Ballymoney, 1859-1863, discussing various religious issues such as the Great Revival of 1859. Politically, the collection contains over 100 letters to Rev. Armour, 31 of which are from Ulster Protestant Home Rulers supporting his stance in favour of Gladstone's 2nd Home Rule Bill, 1893, a position for which he is best remembered. There is another group of 26 letters, 1878-1928, from Sir John B. Dougherty, Professor at Magee University College, Londonderry, Liberal MP for Londonderry City during World War I and Under Secretary for Ireland in the Asquith Administration. These cover a number of subjects including the UVF gun-running, the political situation in Britain and the Irish Convention. However, it is Armour's own voluminous letters to his sons, particularly during the Ulster crisis, c.1912-22, which make up the great bulk of the political papers. A keen educationalist, Armour's lifelong work and involvement in the field of education is also well-represented in the content of the archive. There is much correspondence about subjects such as: intermediate education in the 1880s and Armour's vigorous support for it in the educational debates of the General Assembly arising out if his involvement as principal and teacher of Ballymoney Intermediate School from 1878; the Irish University question after 1900 and, in particular, the Irish universities bill of 1908, which he championed, and his work as a member of Senate of Queen's University of Belfast between 1910 and 1914.","The principal strength of the Armour Papers lies in the quality and depth of the political correspondence, etc., which provides a valuable insight into the Protestant Home Ruler perspective and viewpoint from the 1880s to the 1920s.

192,Cherry Papers ,D/2166,,"Legal, political and family papers and documents comprising the records of the eminent Irish academic, lawyer and politician, Richard Robert Cherry (1859-1923), Attorney General for Ireland 1905-1909, Lord Justice of Appeal 1909-1914, and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland 1914-1916. He is best known for his work and expertise in land law in Ireland, a subject upon which he published extensively including three editions of a work on the various Irish Land Law and Land Purchase Acts between 1881 and 1891. Many of  the legal issues which concerned Cherry are documented in the archive. Running in tandem and often intertwined with his practice at the Bar was Cherry's politicial career. He unsuccessfully contested the Kirkdale Division of Liverpool as a Liberal in the 1900 election (it was during the Boer War and he suffered by being stigmatised as a pro-Boer) before he was returned for Exchange Division in 1906. Not surprisingly, therefore, the collection sheds some light upon grass-roots Liberal politics in the Edwardian era and, in particular, the organisation of the Liberal Party in Liverpool. However, by far the greater part of the political papers comprise letters to Cherry from leading British and Irish politicians of the day including: Sir Edward Carson, John Redmond, Viscount Gladstone, James Bryce, Augustine Birrell, Reginald McKenna and Lord Loreburn. It is apparent that these figures valued Cherry's opinions highly as the correspondence reveals a great willingness on their part to explain and account for their various political actions and Ministerial decisions. The collection also contains interesting family correspondence including letters, 1887-1907, from his brother, John B. Cherry, who emigrated to Canada and had unsuccessful attempts to succeed as a Barrister in Vancouver (in 1914, he returned to Ireland to work as secretary to his brother).","The strength of the Cherry Papers lies mainly in the information they provide for students of political history in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras.

Down, 1733-1972. The Southwell Charity was founded in 1733 by the Rt Hon. Edward Southwell (1705-1755), MP for the Borough of  Downpatrick in the Irish Parliament (also member of the Privy Council and Principal Secretary of State for Ireland, 1720-55), to house the orphaned young and aged indigent, and to educate the poor young. The property now belongs to the Dunleath family having been passed to John Mulholland, 1st Baron Dunleath in the mid 19th century.   The archive is a rich resource recording the vicissitudes of the Charity and the School spanning three centuries. There are title deeds, leases, legal agreements, testamentary papers etc., relating to Edward Southwell's estate. These include the codicil to the will of Edward Southwell, 28 July 1750, in which he made provision for the endowment of the Southwell Charity, leases for tenements in Irish Street, Downpatrick, 1722, and bundles of agreements for tenancies and for the appointment of teachers and a Medical Officer, 1864-1920. Rule 11 in Southwell's list of instructions regarding how the school and almshouses were to be run stipulated the recording of details about each individual and this has survived in the form of a book giving names, etc., of men and women taken in, and of boys and girls admitted to the schools and their trade on leaving.

194,Wallace Papers,D/1889,,"Papers and correspondence of Colonel Robert Hugh Wallace (1860-1929), head of the firm of Messrs Hugh Wallace and Co., Solicitors, Belfast and Downpatrick. The archive comprises: political correspondence, 1893-1923, with leading Unionists such as Sir Edward Carson, James Craig and Walter H. Long; diaries and correspondence covering the Boer War, 1899-1902, where Wallace served with distinction as Lieutenant Colonel of the 5th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles; papers relating to World War I, 1912-1914, when he was Commander of the North Belfast Regiment of the Ulster Volunteer Force and, 1914-1918, when he raised and trained the 17th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles and subsequently took over command of the 19th Battalion until his retirement in January 1918.  Documenting Wallace's role as a leading Orangeman (County Grand Master of Belfast 1903-1921 and Grand President of the Grand Orange Council of the World 1909-1912), the collection also includes correspondence, 1897-1906, and two volumes containing the main part of a detailed manuscript history of Orangeism in Ireland written and compiled by him, and dated 1899. Church papers in the collection include antiquarian and original material, 1734-1927, largely pertaining to Down Cathedral, of which he was Secretary and Treasurer for a number of years, and Down Parish Church. These also touch upon matters such as the sectarian strife of the early 1920s when there were Republican attacks on Church property. Other interesting aspects of the collection relate to the history of Downpatrick including a volume of maps and surveys of the town, 1708-1839. There is also documentation about the Masonic Order, 1883-1929, of which Colonel Wallace was a member, and a wide range of miscellaneous material including: a minute book of the Committee of Subscribers for the Relief of the poor in Downpatrick, 1801; a volume containing fifteen photographs, 1859, of army officers in Australia and a journal of H.G. Moore, Downpatrick, serving as a member of the British army in South Africa, 1873-1877.","The Wallace Papers are particularly strong because of the wide range of subjects which they provide information about for the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These include political history, military history, church history, the Orange Order, etc. In addition, they constitute a substantive database of varied reference material for the area of Downpatrick.","c.950 individually numbered documents, 35 volumes and 32 photographs, 1708-1945, comprising a range of correspondence, diaries, maps, surveys, legal documents and printed and pictorial material and occupying 15 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

195,Whyte Papers,D/2918,,"Estate, family and political papers of the Whyte family, Loughbrickland, Co. Down, 1622-1950. This collection is of considerable significance partly because the Whytes are by Irish standards a very old-established family, their ancestors having come to Ireland with Strongbow in 1170, and partly because they are a Roman Catholic gentry family who weathered the penal era without losing their Loughbrickland estate and without at any stage changing their religion.   The estate, household and family part of the collection includes: title deeds, 1611-1894; leases and agreements for property mainly in Tullyear, Loughbrickland, Dooghary, Ballydown and Coolnacran, Co. Down, 1739-1913; rentals and rent accounts, 1738-1913; estate and financial correspondence, 1773-1916, which includes references to the construction of Loughbrickland Chapel, 1827-33; household and personal accounts of the Whyte family, 1816-c.1900. There are also maps, surveys and valuations, 1727-c.1900, one of which shows the village of Loughbrickland in 1819, and some sketches of Loughbrickland House, 1840-1860. All generations of the Whyte family were widely-travelled and this is reflected in the cosmopolitan nature of parts of the archive which includes letters from various members of the family while on military service in India, during the Boer War and during World War I.  The Whyte family also played a significant role in Co. Down politics and there are 132 letters, 1816-63, about patronage and local politics and administration documenting the activities of John Joseph Whyte (1826-1902) and Nicholas Whyte (1785-1867), the first Roman Catholic High Sheriff of Co. Down, 1830-1. Correspondents include Viscount Castlereagh (1769-1822), Lord Dufferin (1826-1902) and Lord Downshire and the letters pertain to issues such as Catholic Emancipation, the Great Reform Bill and the new Poor Law system for Ireland. As a leading Roman Catholic, the views and role of Nicholas Whyte on subjects such as Catholic Emancipation were highly regarded. The papers also include genealogical notes and pedigrees pertaining to the Whyte family, 1110-c.1930, copies of newspapers and magazines retained because of references to the Whyte family in them, c.1880-c.1950, and official documents of appointments to various positions by members of the family, 1732-1863.",The principal strength of the collection lies in the general point that it is unusual to find such detailed documentation of a small to medium sized estate like Loughbrickland.,"c. 4,000 items, 1622-1950, comprising a range of documents, volumes, photographs, press cuttings etc. occupying 23 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

The collection deals not only with the administration of the workhouses and the relief of the poor but also with emigration and many aspects of local government, particularly in the period between the establishment of Boards of Guardians in 1838 and the transfer of certain of their powers to local authorities by the Local Government Act of 1898 which created county councils elected by ratepayers. There are complete sets of minute books, 1839-1948, for almost all the Unions. Several Unions have important admission and discharge registers from 1839; these provide details such as names, age, religious denomination, occupation, marital status and why relief needed to be given.   The archive also contains outdoor relief admission and discharge books, lists, registers, abstracts and classified returns. These comprise an important record of the poor given that, at the height of the Famine in February 1848, an estimated 1,433,042 persons, from all categories of pauper, were in receipt of outdoor relief throughout Ireland. Another constituent of the archive for many of the Unions include returns of births and deaths, correspondence, various Committee minute books (e.g. Sanitary Committee, Dispensary Committee, Boarding-out Committee), contracts and tenders, financial records, report books of visiting Committees and the masters' journals and return books.","A particular strength of this huge collection is that it deals with a section of the population (i.e. the poor) who, by and  large, hardly recorded or had anything recorded about them individually, on paper. It therefore fills a huge gap. It is also the leading source for historians of the Great Famine between 1845 and 1852.","The Board of Guardian Papers consist of c.14,000 items comprising a range of documents, volumes (most of which are outsize), files and printed material and occupying c.3,950 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

Comprising a range of doumentary material, this collection reflects all areas of concern to Beresford and charts his career and activities as both churchman and member of the powerful Beresford Family.  The collection contains, firstly (under reference D/664), papers illustrating the manipulation of parliamentary seats controlled by the Beresfords especially with regard to the Derry election in 1830; the Primate's involvement in such questions as Catholic Emancipation, the National Education scheme and the Maynooth grant; political correspondence with the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel and the Archbishop of Canterbury; religious correspondence pertaining to the administration of the archdiocese of Armagh, the management of church lands and the progress of such schemes as the restoration of Armagh Cathedral. Beresford’s role as patron to St Columba's College and Trinity College Dublin is also well documented as is his support of the Clergy Orphan Society and the Society for the Relief of the Irish Society left destitute by the Tithe War.  The collection (under D/3279) is also notable for letters and papers, 1823 and 1832-9, about tithe composition and reform and about agitation and protests against the collection of tithe, including an account book of the Clerical Relief Fund, 1832-9, and discussion about the plight of the distressed clergy of the diocese of Elphin; letters and papers, 1825-56, about National Education, conflicts with the Church and Diocesan Education Societies etc., including voluminous correspondence on the subject, occupying most of the first half of June 1845, between Beresford and the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel; letters and papers 1826-44, relating to elections and local politics in the various constituencies dominated by the Beresford family; letters and papers 1830-51, concerning the propagation of the Protestant religion through the Irish language; and letters and papers 1831-5, about Irish Church reform, with particular reference to the Commission of Ecclesiastical Inquiry, the Irish Church Bill of 1833 etc., including draft memoranda by Beresford about the value of Church livings and of archbishoprics and bishoprics.

Other items of note include c.30 documents relating to the Orr family, Coleraine, Co. Londonderry, 1739-1827, comprising detailed accounts and correspondence of the family's activities as linen merchants and bleachers, 1765-1804; and c.500 documents, c.1823-1902, relating to the Dunbar family of Woburn, Millisle, Co. Down (one of Beresford's nieces married George Dunbar, DL, of Woburn, who was MP for Belfast, 1835-41). Dunbar's correspondence, slight in political content and chiefly concerned with the management of the family estates at Woburn, with the developing dock area of Belfast and with family and financial affairs is included as are accounts of the Great Famine in the Culdaff area of Co. Donegal, 1846-47, and correspondence with Beresford over the Armagh election of 1855.  Attention is also drawn to a miscellaneous collection of Beresford material held at other institutions and copied by PRONI (Reference T/2772).

The collection includes extensive runs of administrative, financial, and technical records charting the evolution and development of the Company from its formal establishment in 1862. Remembered principally as the builders of the ill-fated passenger liner, the Titanic, Harland & Wolff is ranked amongst one of the most important and globally influential shipbuilding firms of the early 20th century. Reflecting 125 years of the Company's history, this collection stands as a testimony not only to the achievements of Harland & Wolff as a company, but also to the development of the ship building industry itself, the changing face of international trade and travel and the factors that impacted on it, e.g. World War. The collection itself consists of comprehensive series of minute books, reports, correspondence, financial ledgers, wage books, technical specifications, press cuttings, press releases and photographs etc. Of particular note are the business papers of senior officials including Viscount Pirrie (1847-1924), who led Harland & Wolff from 1896-1924, Sir Frederick Rebbeck, Chairman, 1930-62, Dr Denis Rebbeck, 1962-70, and Sir John Mallabar, 1966-70.

Elected first to the Irish Parliament in 1790 to represent Co Down and subsequently in the English Parliament from 1794-1822, Castlereagh rose to play a dominant role in British policy and politics. As acting Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland he dealt decisively with the leaders of the '98 Rebellion and was officially appointed to the Chief Secretaryship in November 1798. He devoted the next two years to promoting the passage through the Irish Parliament of legislation for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland but resigned, with Pitt, when George III refused to grant Catholic Emancipation. In 1802, he became President of the Board of Control, and Secretary for War and the Colonies in 1805-6 and 1807-9 which he resigned after the disastrous conclusion of the Walcheren expedition and his duel with the Foreign Secretary, George Canning. From 1812 until his death in 1822, he was both Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons at a time of intense military and political activity in many arenas which is reflected in the collection. He was at the heart of the coalition against Napoleon (1813-14) and represented England at Chaumont and Vienna (1814-15), Paris (1815) and Aix-la-Chapelle (1818). <br><br>The core of 'The Castlereagh Papers' comprises some 37 volumes containing 6,217 letters and papers which were arranged and bound in the 3rd Marquess's time and were selectively published under his remote editorial control as the Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh (12 vols, London, 1848-1853). In addition, there are two further bound volumes containing engraved portraits of contemporary personalities with letters from them to Castlereagh and letters between Castlereagh and Lord Melville (1804-1805), letters from Castlereagh and the 1st Marquess of Londonderry to their agent, Rev. John Cleland (1790-1810) and letters between Castlereagh and the future 3rd Marquess about family settlements (1810-1822).

237,Hamilton Deeds,D/57-D/151,,"Collection of deeds, 1639-1841, rich in both historical content and geographical variety and relating, in part, to the Hamilton Family of Hamilton's Bawn, Armagh, and their local area. The subject matter of the collection is, however, very varied, and reference will be found to various parts of Ireland. The earliest documents to be found date from c. 1638 and 1654. The first is a confirmation by the 'patentees entrusted with the lands lately passed on the Plantation of the Byrne's country in the County of Wicklow'. This document confirms a lease of 1638, made by Redmond McFeagh Byrne, James Flatsborough, and John Walsh to Sir Henry Tichborne in the barony of Ballaghkeen North, Co. Wexford and in the barony of Arklow, Co. Wicklow. Numerous subsequent deeds in the collection relate to this Tichborne family, mostly in connection with lands in Louth. The second document, dated 1654, contains particulars of various lands in the barony of Ardee, Co. Louth, with the names of the former proprietors and of the parliamentary soldiers to whom they were subsequently assigned during the Cromwellian confiscations. <br><br>The Hamilton family name appears with the fifth deed, dated 24th November 1674. This is a lease from Sir Hans Hamilton, of Hamilton's Bawn, Armagh, to Sir William Tichborne of the Wicklow lands above. The fifteenth deed in the collection, dated 1682, introduces the locality with which the deeds are mainly connected, namely Killinchy, Killyleagh and the surrounding vicinity in Co. Down. Some interesting references occur in subsequent deeds.  There are references to High Street, Downepost Street, Shore Street, Cow Street and Plantation Street, Killyleagh, and to Quarry Hole, Seaforde, Co. Down. Archibald Hamilton Rowan, of Killyleagh Castle, the celebrated United Irishman, is a party to several of the later deeds, but no reference is made to his political career. In 1835, a Portaferry and Strangford Steamboat Company was projected, and the collection contains a draft memorandum of association. This company appears to have been intended for the purpose of providing a steamboat ferry between the two towns. The capital was to be £1,000, but the papers do not indicate whether the project was successful. <br><br>The collection also includes a number of references to Donegal, particularly to the manor of Ray and to the property of the Brazier family in that county and in Co. Limerick. There is a lease from Arthur, Earl of Donegall, to John Cowan, a merchant of Londonderry, of lands in the manors of Elagh and Buncranagh [sic] in 1698 and some references to 18th century Dublin are also to be found. A deed of 1726 states that certain premises on the north side of Castle Street were formerly the banking premises of Benjamin Burton and Francis Harrison. One Richard Guinness appears in a document of 1790, in connection with premises held by him at Leixlip.

238,Hume Papers,D/2765,,"Personal papers of the Hume family of New South Wales, Australia, Liverpool and Castlerock, Co. Antrim. Comprising correspondence, accounts, notebooks and other papers, the collection documents the activities, interests and history of successive generations of the family from the late 17th century onwards. <br><br>The best known member of the family was Hamilton Hume (1797-1873) who was born in Toongabbie, New South Wales, son of Andrew Hamilton Hume of Hillsborough, Co. Down (b. 1762) who emigrated to the Antipodes in 1788. Hamilton Hume was the first native-born Australian explorer. His most notable expedition was with William Hilton Hovell in 1824 from Lake George, New South Wales to Geelong, a distance of 400 miles, during which they became the first white men to see the Australian Alps. Because of his expeditionary exploits, the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne is named after him. There is much correspondence in the archive dating from 1824-72 pertaining to Hume's pioneering explorations in southern Australia and the potential he saw for that part of the country. <br><br>Other notable items include c.50 letters written to the Rev. Abraham Hume, dating from 1843-84 and relating to his genealogical work and activities as vicar of the parish of Vauxhall in Liverpool, together with some private papers and his etymological and genealogical working papers, c.1850-c.1870. The son of Thomas F. Hume of Hillsborough, he was educated in Belfast, Dublin and Glasgow, and was vicar of Vauxhall from 1847 until his death in 1884. He took an active part in the public, educational and ecclesiastical movements in Liverpool and fought for the establishment of an episcopate for Liverpool. Before his death, he had set in motion the plans for the erection of a new cathedral in the town, as the later correspondence reveals.

241,Records of the Lagan Navigation and Associated Companies,COM/1,,"Records of the Lagan Navigation and associated companies, 1783-1954. Comprising papers relating to the Lagan Navigation, the Ulster Canal, the Tyrone Navigation or Coleraine Canal and the Upper Bann Navigation, these records provide a valuable insight into the development of the inland waterway system in the north of Ireland from the late 18th century onwards. <br><br>In terms of the Lagan Navigation, plans for a canal linking the River Lagan and Lough Neagh were first mooted as far back as 1637. It was not until the discovery of coal in Tyrone, however, that these plans were taken forward with the passing of appropriate statutory articles in 1753. Although various setbacks prevented its implementation for some years, the canal was operational by 1794 and was administered initially by the Commissioners of Public Works until the incorporation of the Lagan Navigation Company in 1843. The company was dissolved in 1954 when its assets were taken over by the Ministry of Commerce. Although no records of the canal survive from before 1777, this section of the archive is particularly rich in documentation from 1800 onwards. It comprises minute books from 1809, letter books of the same date, business accounts from 1792-1951, and a large number of 19th and early 20th century maps. Of particular interest are the letter books of James McCleery which run from 1809-52. McCleery was secretary to the Lagan Navigation, the Ulster Canal and the Belfast Charitable Society and his letters include communications with each and contain comments on life in Belfast and in the province more generally.<br><br>The remainder of the collection comprises records relating to the Ulster Canal, the Tyrone Navigation or Coleraine Canal and the Upper Bann Navigation, which all eventually came under the control of the Lagan Navigation Company. Although not as extensive as the previous section they do provide a useful compliment. Opened in 1842 the Ulster Canal extended from Charlemont in Co. Armagh to Lough Erne in the west of the province. Extant minutes commence after amalgamation with the Lagan Navigation in 1888, although information concerning the early years of the Ulster Canal can be found in the earlier letter books of the Lagan Navigation. 350 title deeds of the canal also survive, together with some maps dating from 1824-1926. <br><br>The Tyrone Navigation or Coalisland Canal, from Coalisland to Lough Neagh, was begun in 1732 and was also taken over by Lagan Navigation in 1888. Its records are limited to a few late title deeds and some maps, 1861-1910. The Upper Bann Navigation was begun in 1847 and completed in 1859 when the canal was handed over to local trustees. Only six minute, account and toll books, 1900-45, and five correspondence files and traffic returns, 1863-1946, pertaining to the company have survived. Finally, the collection also includes the minutes of evidence and appendices, etc., of the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways, 1906-22.","The principal strength of the collection lies in the material it contains relating to history of canals in Ulster from the late-nineteenth century onwards. This is particularly so because it contains records pertaining to a number of navigation companies. Also, the collection contains a wide range of material on other subjects such as railways, charities, education and social mores.","c. 1,200 items, 1783-1954, comprising a range of documents, outsize volumes and maps and plans occupying c.105 PRONI boxes.",Collection.

242,Montgomery Family Papers,"D/627, T/1089",,"Estate and personal papers of the Montgomery family of Blessingbourne, Fivemiletown, Co. Tyrone, c.1650-1924, and, in particular, those of Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery (1844-1924), a senator of the Northern Ireland Parliament from 1922-24.<br><br>The estate papers relate to lands in Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh around Fivemiletown and Enniskillen. They are of the normal estate classes and include maps dating from 1728, account books, rent rolls, lists of free holders, mortgages, leases, surveys and conveyances, running from about 1650 to 1900. <br><br>By far the most important section of this collection, however, are the letters and papers of Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery (1844-1924), which are particularly complete reflecting all aspects and avenues of his life as both an Ulster landlord and politician from his coming of age in 1865 to his death in 1924. He can be studied in all his phases: as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford; as a landlord interested in the welfare of his local community and society; and as a father of a growing family for which he built Blessingbourne House. Letters and papers relating to his tenants and lands are particularly extensive and enlightening. These discuss everything that happened in Cos. Tyrone and Fermanagh during his tenure: abatements, local quarrels, distress funds, Land Bills and Acts, all aspects of local government and the affairs of tenants; in these letters the part played by the local estate in provincial life can be studied in detail.<br><br>The collection also contains files of letters concerning Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery's activities before Royal Commissioners, in the Liberal Unionist Association and in the Irish Landowners' Convention; letters about the Irish Convention from such people as Sir James Strong, Edward Carson, the Bishop of Down, the Archbishop of Armagh, Dawson Bates and A.V. Dicey. Later, between 1918 and 1922 there is correspondence with almost everybody prominent in Irish political life on the Unionist side. <br><br>Among other items in the collection are letters of Lady Noel Byron, Edward Lear, W.E. Gladstone, James Craig, A.J. Balfour, Lord Hartington, Joseph Chamberlain, Horace Plunkett and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, O'Connor Don, Hubert Parry and Walter Long.

Dating from 1941 to 1955 this collection is particularly comprehensive for the period between 1945 and 1947 and contains mainly material of relevance to Mulvey’s political and parliamentary career during which he was, for a time, the principal Irish Nationalist represented in the British Parliament. <br><br>Half of the archive consists of letters from constituents, family correspondence and notes for speeches. Issues covered include the Irish language, evictions at Belmont camp, Londonderry, electoral register matters, identity cards, etc. More significantly there are: c. 100 letters from Stormont Nationalist MP's, Cahir Healy, Edward McAteer and Malachy Conlon; c. 30 letters from H.G. McGhee and Hugh Delargy, Treasurer and Secretary, respectively, of the ' Friends of Ireland ' Group in the Labour Party; c. 20 letters from J. Chuter-Ede, the British Home Secretary, replying to Mulvey's approaches on matters such as prison reform, etc.; c.20 letters concerning anti-Partition League organisation in Britain; and 8 letters from Gabriel Diskin, a Dublin journalist who acted as an intermediary between Mulvey and Eamon de Valera, Taoiseach of Eire. <br><br>The collection also includes an interesting typescript autobiography of Mulvey describing his childhood in West Breffni, Co. Cavan in the 1880s and 1890s. This contains detailed descriptions of folk customs, methods of agriculture, Gaelic forms of speech in English, Michael Davitt's Land League agitation, and Nationalist and Sinn Fein political meetings.","The collection is particularly significant in that it is one of the few archives in existence and publicly available which documents the work and life of a post-Partition, Irish Nationalist politician in Northern Ireland.","c. 300 items comprising a range of documents, files, printed material and newspaper cuttings 1941-1955 and occupying  4 PRONI boxes.",Collection.Archive.Text.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

245,Pilson Manuscripts,D/365,,"Seven manuscript volumes and one typescript copy of a volume, 1775-1863, comprising the records of Mr. Aynsworth Pilson of Downpatrick. One of the volumes is merely an account book recording transactions, 1826-62, and another is entitled ''Memoirs of notable inhabitants of Downpatrick''. It provides much detail about 79 inhabitants of the town including Pilson himself who, we are told, had an income of £430 per annum by 1844. This probably had much to do with his father who had a distillery and tan yard which latter business he made over to his only son in whose hands it apparently prospered.<br><br>In his early years, Aynsworth Pilson took part in public affairs, but he was not prepared to subordinate his private interests to them. Thus, after a connection of about twelve months with the Volunteers he resigned as he found he could not give sufficient attention to his tan yard. In later years he served on several local committees, such as Poor Law, Library, etc. He seldom travelled far from home and consequently his diaries relate almost exclusively to his own private affairs and to those of Downpatrick and its neighbourhood. To people from that district Pilson's volumes should be of considerable interest.

246,Schomberg MacDonnell Papers,"D/4091, MIC/615",,"This archive incorporates the papers of the Hon. Sir Schomberg MacDonnell, Louisa Countess of Antrim, Sir John Stuart and the Stuart family of Dalness, Argyllshire. It brings together a range of interesting and important personalities from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and provides valuable insights into political and court life at this time. Most of the collection relates to Schomberg MacDonnell, fifth son of the 5th Earl of Antrim, and covers virtually all of his life (1861-1915) in varying detail.<br><br>Schomberg MacDonnell was Private Secretary to Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, during a period when he was Prime Minister (1888-1902); subsequently he became Secretary of the Office of Works from 1902-12, having much to do with royal coronations and funerals; he served in the Boer War with the City of London Volunteers and in World War I with the 5th Cameron Highlanders. He was mortally wounded at Flanders. His papers and diaries reflect his activities in political, military, court and social life.<br><br>The papers of Louisa Countess of Antrim, who married the 6th Earl of Antrim in 1875, are in many respects similar to those of Schomberg MacDonnell. They were both on intimate terms with the royal family whom they served. Louisa was the daughter of General Charles Grey who had been appointed Prince Albert's Private Secretary in 1849 and, after the Prince's death, Queen Victoria's. Her grandfather was the Prime Minister Earl Grey of the 1832 Reform Bill. The collection contains some papers relating to both Louisa's father and grandfather. She served as a Lady in Waiting to both Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra. Her letters and diaries include correspondence from many of the members of the royal family, and papers relating to Home Rule which she opposed.<br><br>The archive of Sir John Stuart, from Ballachullish, Argyllshire, barrister, MP and Vice Chancellor, comprises letters from Benjamin Disraeli, estate and family papers relating to his daughter-in-law Elizabeth MacDonald Stuart who left her estate in Dalness, Argyllshire, to Sir Schomberg MacDonnell in order that it should remain in the MacDonald clan.","Of interest to those researching political, court and social life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries","c. 2,000 documents occupying 6 PRONI boxes",Collection.

247,Seven Years' War Diary.,D/678,,"Diary, July-September, 1760, with enclosed copy correspondence, July-August, 1759, relating to the British campaign in Canada during the Seven Years' War. The writer of the diary was probably an officer on the staff of Brigadier General James Murray, and, as he appears to have had an intimate knowledge of all that occurred, he may have been a secretary. The supposition is strengthened by the presence in the diary of copies of correspondence which passed between Murray and his superior, Major-General James Wolfe. The copy letters are in the same hand as the diary and appear to be contemporary. Included is a copy of Wolfe's order to Generals Murray, Monckton and Townshend giving alternative plans for the capture of Quebec and asking for their comments, and the minutes of the Council of War between the Generals in compliance with the order. The diary itself presents a day-to-day account of the campaign in Canada covering the months leading to the capture of Montreal and the capitulation of the French on 8th September, 1760.",This diary and the associated papers are an important and valuable research tool for students of the Seven Years' War in relation to North America.,1 diary and 10 documents,Collection.Archive.Text.,"The collection is stored in secure, closed accommodation and can be requested for on-site consultation using an in-house document ordering system.

249,Tipping Papers,"D/4160, MIC/555",,"Personal, political and financial papers of the Tipping family of Bellurgan Park, Ballymascanlan, Co Louth, and their estates in Counties Louth, Armagh, Down and Westmeath. <br><br>The collection includes many wills, probates and letters of administration of the Tipping and other families, but the bulk of the archive consists of letters and papers of Edward Tipping II (1826-96), who inherited Bellurgan Park and the Tipping estate during the Famine. In consequence of the inherited debts on the property, the Famine and subsequently the Land War of 1880-1881, Edward Tipping II was in financial difficulties for the whole of his life, which the sale of a significant part of the estate through the Encumbered Estates Court in 1855 did not relieve. His papers are of interest as showing (perhaps in an extreme instance) the plight of the landlord class in the second half of the 19th century. <br><br>These papers are also of interest in their own right because he was an activist and pamphleteer on various issues including the Land Acts, Disestablishment and the post-Disestablishment organisation of the Church of Ireland, 1869-1882, and the reform and retrenchment in the Irish prison system, 1872-1879. His local - as opposed to national - offices, appointments etc, included: JP for Co. Louth, 1849-1896; lieutenant in the Louth Militia, 1855-1856; director of the Dundalk and Greenore Railway Company, 1862-1870; member of the Carlingford Lough Commission, 1864-c.1877; and County Inspector of Prisons, 1866-c.1876. These activities are all fully documented in the archive, particularly Tipping's role as a county inspector of prisons. In 1872-1879 he seems to have been the organiser of the campaign which the county inspectors fought on an all-Ireland basis against the reduction of their offices and emoluments.","Of interest to those researching estate management, especially landlords in financial difficulties","c. 8,500 documents occupying 15 PRONI boxes",Collection.

250,Ulster Gift Fund Papers,D/912,,"Records of the Ulster Gift Fund, 1938-1947. Formed in September 1939, the Ulster Gift Fund was established by the women of Ulster in an attempt to help ease the suffering of local men engaged in the Second World War. Providing clothing and bandages to military hospitals and woollen comforts to serving troops, the fund was organised by a large number of Ulsterwomen from all parts of the province and from all sections of society. Its membership ran to many thousands co-ordinated into 298 depots with headquarters at 2 Bedford Street, Belfast. In May 1942 a Prisoners-of-War service was instituted and for the next three-and-a-half years the Fund came to be the channel of communication with London on all subjects relevant to prisoners from Northern Ireland. With the end of the war, the balance of the Fund's huge stockpiles of hospital supplies, was gradually distributed throughout civilian hospitals in Northern Ireland and branches of the Red Cross and the balance of comforts likewise issued to men still on active service. The work of the Fund finally ended on 28 February, 1946.<br><br>Central to the records in this collection of papers is the minute book of the Central Committee for War Hospital Supply Depots, continued as minutes of the Central Committee of the Ulster Gift Fund (with sub-committee minutes), 1939-1944. Also in the collection are over 2,000 individual sheets giving the personal details of some 2,300 prisoners-of-war with next of kin in Northern Ireland. The details given include the name and address of next of kin, date of capture, location of prison camp, changes of camp with relevant dates, etc. The accurate and assiduous way in which these details were catalogued and indexed by the Fund renders them all the more valuable. In addition, there are financial books and papers concerning the Fund, Oct., 1939-Sept. 1947, including the sums of money raised by the various depots. There are also financial papers and other documentation concerning the Ulster Gift Fund Scholarship which sponsored certain students at Queen's University whose fathers had been on active service during the war. Photographic material includes one showing a visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the Gift Fund premises in June, 1942. Finally, it should be noted that the Secretary of the Fund, Miss Nancy Kingham, was also transport officer of the Unionist Party, Glengall St. Belfast and this has resulted in the existence in the archive of some election leaflets, circulars and statistics, etc., 1941-70.",The collection is strong on detail in relation to voluntary efforts on behalf of the armed forces during the Second World War.

251,Ulster Women's Unionist Council Papers,D/1098; D/2688,,"Records of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council and its various branches and associations, 1892-1975. <br><br>Officially established on 23 January 1911, the formation of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council was a significant event in the history of women's political activism in Ireland. Initiated as the female equivalent to the main Ulster Unionist Council, it was established as an auxiliary organisation to oppose home rule, promote unionist propaganda and preserve the legislative union between Great Britain and Ireland. Within a year of its establishment it was easily the largest female political group Ireland had ever seen, with an estimated membership of 115,000-200,000.  On the outbreak of World War I the organisation became engaged in extensive charity work, making arrangements to care for those who were discharged from the forces on medical grounds and inaugurating the Ulster Women's Gift Fund for Soldiers. After the Representation of the People Act in 1918 the movement became involved in the registration of women voters. Subsequent reorganisation involved speakers' classes, meetings that combined education with entertainment, and the holding of meetings outside Belfast to increase interest in the work of the Women's Council at a local level. <br><br>The papers held in this collection reflect all levels of activity of the Council from its establishment in 1911 and comprise a range of volumes, documents and photographs. These include minute books of the UWUC Executive Committee, 1911-1940, annual reports, papers and minutes of the Ulster Women’s Gift Fund and a series of minute books drawn from various local branches set up throughout the north of Ireland. These feature minute books of the Women's Unionist Association, North Tyrone, 1907; General Committee Minute Book of St Anne's Women's Unionist Association, 1918-23; records of North Down Women's Unionist Association, 1914-69; Minute book of Ballycastle Branch of North Antrim Women's Unionist Association, 1911-34; and Minute book of Strandtown Branch of Victoria Women's Unionist Association, 1947-58.",The collection is particularly strong for students of unionism and Irish women's history in the early twentieth century.,"c. 150 items which comprising a range of documents, volumes, photographs, pamphlets and publications dating from 1892 to 1975.

Born in 1840, son of John Wilkinson of Belfast and Annabella Shaw of Waringstown, Co. Down, Wilkinson led a distinguished legal and diplomatic career in the Far East during the late 19th and early 20th centuries holding various positions in Japan, China and Korea including that of Vice-Consul in Japan, 1877, Acting Assistant Judge at Shanghai in 1879 and Crown Advocate in 1881. He was also British Commissioner for the settlement of claims after the Canton riots in 1883, Judge of HM Court for Japan, 1897-1900, and Chief Justice of HM Supreme Court for China and Korea, 1900-1905. <br><br>Of the non-official papers to be found in the collection, there are a number of interesting letters sent to him from his brother-in-law, Samuel Gaffikin, in Belfast, 1867-1870, referring to lectures at the Methodist College in Belfast, the visit of Prince Arthur to the North of Ireland and rioting in Londonderry, the education of destitute Roman Catholic children in industrial schools and the linen trade. Other papers and correspondence pertain to the Irish Convention in 1918, a threatening letter etc. from the Irish Republican Army in March 1922, a detailed personal account book of Wilkinson's father, John, whilst working in Belfast, 1827-1841, and some Irish Land Commission papers relating to the Wilkinson property at Moneyshanere, Co. Londonderry, c.1900-c.1930.

253,Young & Mackenzie Papers,D/2194,,"Business records and other papers of Young & Mackenzie, Architects, Donegall Square West, Belfast, 1825-1937. Established in 1854, the firm of Young & Mackenzie was originally set up in Belfast by the Rt Hon. Robert Young (1822-1917), who had previously articled with the renowned architect, Charles Lanyon, in partnership with John Mackenzie. They were later joined by Young’s son, Robert, who made a huge personal contribution to the work of the practice by his design of numerous high profile nineteenth century buildings including many Ulster Presbyterian churches, manses and schools; mansions and large warehouses; hospitals for several public authorities and well-known buildings. The Youngs also contributed significantly to contemporary study of various architectural, historical, antiquarian and geological subjects. <br><br>The bulk of the archive consists of specifications, bills of quantities, estimates, plans etc., 1854-1937, relating to the firm's design of public buildings, churches, schools, hospitals etc. throughout the Province, but more particularly in Belfast, for example, the Presbyterian War Memorial Hostel, the Malone, Rosemary Street, Crumlin Road, Knock, Old Park and Donegall Road Presbyterian churches, Belfast Royal Academy, Robinson & Cleaver and the Northern Ireland Fever Hospital. Also of much interest are the administrative records of the firm which include: copy out-letter books, 1904-7, and special copy out-letter books, 1897-1920, concerning work for Belfast Poor Law Union and Belfast Rural District Council; business diaries, 1895-1933; cost book, c.1861-c.1871, with details of consultations with clients.<br><br>In addition to the mass of architectural records generated by the day to day running of the business, the outside cultural interests of the Young’s are also heavily documented in the papers. There is a minute book of the Belfast Architectural Association, 1872-6, formed in 1872 for the study of architectural subjects and Robert Magill Young's manuscript notes from the Pinkerton Manuscripts together with a collection of copper plates showing views of Belfast, 1670-c.1829, which were used by him in his book 'Historical Notices of Old Belfast and its Vicinity'. Also of note are his personal papers, c.1902-1907, including his sketch book containing drawings of details on buildings in Belfast, c.1904. It should be noted that PRONI also holds as a separate collection (ref. D/2930) of other records of the Young family largely consisting of papers collected in the course of their historical research.<br><br>Other themes not strictly pertaining to architecture in the collection include religion, transport and education. There is a diary of the Rev. Robert Magill of 1st Antrim Presbyterian Church, Co. Antrim, 1834; papers of the Belfast and Ballymena Railway Company, 1847; reports of the Belfast and Co. Down Railway Company, 1867 and 1872; a return of schools in Belfast parish for the education of the poor; a return of schools in the Belfast Sunday School Union with details of the number of teachers and scholars in temperance societies etc., 1839; papers of Ladies Collegiate School, Belfast, 1874.","The Young and Mackenzie Papers are particularly strong because of the information which they contain - largely in the form of plans, drawings, specifications etc. - for students researching architecture in Belfast (and to a lesser degree, elsewhere in Ulster) c.1850-c.1930.

The Clokey Stained Glass Studios constituted a separate department of Campbell Brothers, glass merchants of Belfast, which was established in 1904 when W.F. Clokey (c. 1870-1930) went into partnership with his former employer, James A. Campbell. Of Huguenot descent, the Clokey name and product gained nationwide respect and was famed throughout Ireland for its beautiful church windows. Indeed, their designs were so highly valued that great pains were taken during the Second World War to remove them from Belfast and store them in the country for safekeeping. <br><br>Remarkably few original designs survive today as the majority were lost to fire during a bombing incident in the 1970s. Those held in this collection available by the Environment & Heritage Service are thus an important and unique resource. Consisting of some 180 original illustrations and drawings, the collection is divided into four main categories: Domestic Glass designs; Symbolic and Decorative Glass; Narrative and Figurative Glass; and Heraldic and Memorial Glass. Of these, predominant is the work of the local artist, Olive Henry, who joined the firm direct from school in c. 1923.

Commissioned by the then Ancient Monuments Advisory Council, McCutcheon was appointed in 1962 to carry out a comprehensive survey of all industrial monuments in Northern Ireland. This work took some 6 years to complete and involved detailed inspections, assessments and documentation of all the material remains of 18th and 19th century industry and communications extant in the province at that time. The resultant resource concentrates on vital aspects of the region’s industrial and commercial history, highlighting and providing a basic framework for many other areas of inquiry. Specific references are made to sites and features of historical significance or topographical importance particularly those relating to the evolution, adaptation and decline of internal transport systems (roads, bridges, railways and canals), the development of power technology and its impact on Ulster’s flax and linen industry, and the evolution of industry and communication in the north of Ireland more generally. The collection itself contains an extensive photographic archive and a considerable collection of related documentary and archival resources assembled by McCutcheon during the period of research (1962-68). This last element ranges from a large number of original civil engineering and architectural drawings to business records, copy patents, collections of prints and negatives of renaissance technology, miscellaneous correspondence, plans, specifications, biographies, catalogues, and trade brochures etc. McCutcheon’s original field notes are also to be found within the collection.

The 7th Marquess carried on this tradition serving in numerous official positions both locally and nationally which are reflected in the contents of his archive.

In 1932 and 1933 he attended the disarmament conference at Geneva and became Lord Privy Seal for a short time in 1935 which marked the end of his ministerial career. As an influential private individual he also laboured to bring about Anglo-German reconciliation, befriending Goering and Ribbontrop and exposing himself to the charge of being ‘pro-German’. In his retirement, Londonderry served as Chancellor of both the University of Durham and the Queen's University of Belfast and also Lord Lieutenant of Co Durham and HML of Co Down.

An academic of some repute and at one time considered, “the darling of Ulster,” Waddell enjoyed a productive and successful literary career primarily concentrating on translation and medievalism. This collection of her papers stands as testimony to her literary output and process. Included can be found annotated drafts and manuscripts of some of her most important works including her first publication, ‘Lyrics from the Chinese’ (1913), her seminal study of ‘The Wandering Scholars’ (1927) for which she was awarded the A.C. Benson Silver Medal by the Royal Society of Literature, her play, ‘The Abbé Prévost’ (1931) and the historical novel ‘Peter Abelard’ (1933). Other series of Latin translations featured in the collection include incomplete drafts of her ‘Medieval Latin Lyrics’ (1929), “Beasts and Saints” (1934), “The Desert Fathers” (1936) and her original workings of the posthumously published, “More Latin Lyrics” which appeared in 1976. An incomplete draft of the W.P. Ker Memorial Lecture entitled ‘Poetry in the Dark Ages’ which Waddell delivered to the University of Glasgow in 1947 is also present. Waddell’s correspondence with George Saintsbury provides a complementary look at her career. Initiated in 1914 following their first meeting, they maintained regular contact until Saintsbury’s death in 1933. The fruits of that correspondence bear witness to the strength of their friendship and admiration for each other’s abilities with many personal and literary subjects touched on throughout the 324 letters that are to be found. The collection also includes a bound ‘mock-up’ copy of an anthology of Waddell’s writings (affectionately referred by the two as ‘The Pig Book’) that Saintsbury had compiled for publication. The preparation of this work is mentioned in the correspondence. The collection also includes a separate series of papers concerning Otto Kyllmann (d. 1957), a senior partner in Waddell’s publishers, Constable &amp; Co. These papers consist mainly of a series of letters received by Kyllmann during the period, 1900-57. A bound manuscript of the first edition of George Meredith’s ‘Poems’ (London, 1851), copied by an unknown hand, is also to be found.","This collection is particularly valuable to the student of language and literature through the availability of many of Waddell's original literary manuscripts, providing a unique insight into her methodologies and work processes, an insight which is heightened through the inclusion of her correspondence with George Saintsbury.","Approx. 600 items consisting of literary manuscripts, correspondence and other papers (5 archival boxes).",Collection.Library.Text.Special,"The collection is available for reference only under supervised access in the Special Collections Reading Room at The McClay Library.

Born in Dublin to Roman Catholic parents in 1779, Thomas Moore went on to become one of Ireland's most popular writers, regarded at the time, as Ireland's national lyricist. Remembered principally for his Irish Melodies, which appeared in numerous editions from 1807-34, he produced quite a substantial portfolio of work of poetic satire, verse, prose and biography, enjoying both financial and literary success during his own lifetime. The core of this particular collection was assembled by the Belfast collector, Andrew Gibson (fl. 1904-1927) during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It consists of many early editions of Moore's work, reflecting the various genres in which he excelled. Included can be found editions of Moore's Irish Melodies, sheet music and other works, some bound in fine and ornate bindings, while still others decorated by some of the most prominent illustrators of the 19th century. Since its acquisition in 1960 (from the P.D. Massie Estate), Queen's has continued to supplement the collection with the addition of various titles relating to Moore, his life and his writing. Modern criticisms, commentaries, musical arrangements and biographies are well represented.","The strength of the Gibson-Massie Moore Collection lies in the completeness of its subject matter.

William Allingham was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal on March 19th 1824. His father was a successful merchant and later a banker in the town. He grew up in Ballyshannon and worked in the bank there and various other towns in Northern Ireland before joining the Customs Service. He finally settled in England, remaining a Civil Servant for twenty five years. He continued to be torn between his love of Ireland and the discomfort he felt there. He was more comfortable in England where he could indulge his cultural interests without being thought odd. He married Helen Paterson, a watercolour artist in 1874, she was almost half his age. His literary career was fairly typical of a lot of Victorian poets. Over a period of 40 years he published in excess of 20 volumes of poetry, criticism, ballads and plays. Tennyson was his idol and he tried to emulate his style in his writings. He was also heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite style of the Rossetti Circle and corresponded with Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Despite his publishing output he is best known for two poems - ""The Fairies"" and ""Four ducks on a pond"". His books are in demand primarily for their illustrations and associations with contemporary literary figures. He was part of the Rossetti Circle and intimate with noted figures of the Victorian literary milieu. Yeats described him as his ""master in Irish verse"".

The collection is of great value to those studying their genealogy and compliments collections held in PRONI.</p>","The Reside Collection contains documents which are of great importance to the study of local history and geneaology in the Newry and Mourne area. The Collection is the product of the professional lives of Major G.W. Reside, an architect and engineer based in Newry and his wife Margaret (neé Fisher), who was a solicitor in the town. Much of this material also reflects Major Reside's enthusiasm for local history and constitutes an essential part of the written heritage of Newry and the wider south Armagh/south Down area. There are various classes of records included in the collection which include Estate Records, Maps and Architectural Plans and other miscellaneous documents. Within the Estate Records, there are rental volumes, titles deeds, maps and estate surveys which mainly relate to the Earls of Kilmorey. Significant material also concerns property owned by the Marquises of Downshire and to a lesser degree the Hall family of Warrenpoint and the Ross family of Rostrevor. There are a considerable number of maps held in the collection which include numerous Ordnance Survey maps. Many of these maps include written annotations relating to ownership of land.",The strength in this collection is the wide variety of material that is included in documents that make up this collection. The rental volumes from the Kilmorey Estate date back to 1802 for the Newry Estate and 1829 for the Kilkeel Estate. These act as a very important census subsititute for the early 1800s. A noteworthy point to mention is the complete run of rentals for the Kilmorey Newry Estate between 1845 and 1851 which note cases of emigration and death from various diseases. The collection has great research potential for those looking to study social history and genealogy of the Newry and Mourne area.,"The collection contains approximately 10,000 documents.",Collection.Museum.Text.Special,Access is supervised and for research and/or reference purposes only.

The collection of correspondence is particularly strong and is further enhanced by items such as Christmas cards, postcards, photographs, newspaper cuttings and scrapbooks; There are also numerous holdings of ephemera, manuscript transcriptions, draft speeches, notebooks (story notes and travelogue notes); Reid was also a keen collector of prints and illustrations, and there are thousands of these organised within the collection. <br /> <br />Reid was apprenticed to the tea trade as a young man, but eventually went up to Cambridge. This did not lead to a blossoming of his literary talent as Reid was to describe his time at university as a ""rather blank interlude"". He returned to Belfast, and during the next forty years lived privately and unostentatiously in the east of the city. Reid corresponded widely however, and his novels established for him a reputation as a notable prose stylist. <br /> <br />The central theme throughout much of his works was boyhood and youth, and Reid himself noted his limitations of scope by pondering that some ""arrested development"" prevented him from fully realizing a world of only adult relationships. Nevertheless, his novels were rich in themes of dream landscapes, animism, paganism, magical transformation, loss and class decline. <br /> <br />Reid also wrote highly regarded critical studies of Yeats and Walter de la Mare, an examination of nineteenth century art, and many essays and short stories. His collection of original illustrations of English woodcut artists of the 1860s is held at the Ashmolean Museum. Many of his original manuscripts are also held in the Belfast, Ulster and Irish Studies of the Belfast Central Library.","There are over 5000 items of correspondence which include many from literary figures such as E M Forster, Walter de la Mare, W B Yeats, AE (George Russell), Joe Ackerly, George Buchanan, Padriac Colum, J S Crone, Basil de Selincourt, Stewart March Ellis, St. John Ervine, Stephen Gilbert, George Faber, Edward Arnold, Louis Golding, Robert Greacen, Lawrence Houseman, John Irvine, Rosamund Jacob, Patrick Kavanagh, Geoffrey Keynes, C S Lewis, Robert Lynd, Francois Mauriac, A N Monkhouse, Edward Muir, Herbert Moore Pim, V S Pritchett, Marc Andre Raffalovich, Richard Ellis Roberts, Michael Sadlier, Hugh Shearman, John Hampson Simpson, John Sparrow, James Stephens, AJA Symonds and Rutherford Mayne. <br /> <br />One of the most significant parts of the Forrest Reid papers is his correspondence with the novelist Edward Morgan Forster (1879-1970).  The correspondence covers a period of thirty-four and a half years (31st January 1912 – 18th August 1946) and includes 217 letters and cards from E.M.

The process of writing is often sharply debated in letters, and creative processes are further illuminated in the heavily revised and densely annotated drafts of works, both published and incomplete.

He had a particular interest in local history and is noted for compiling ‘A Belfast chronicle 1789: a compilation from the Belfast Newsletter.’ He collected a range of books, articles and pamphlets relating to religion in Ireland. This collection contains pamphlets created by local churches for various purposes; it includes histories of certain individual congregations, records of church services, church financial records and souvenir pamphlets created for particular anniversaries. There are also some miscellaneous histories of broader local religious movements and pamphlets relating to theological ideas.  Many of the pamphlets pertain to the 20th Century however there is some older material and some histories refer back as far as the 12th century. The pamphlets are in good condition, while some may be a bit fragile there is no negative impact on the legibility of any of the material. <br /><strong></strong></p>","This collection is particularly strong for individual church records for Belfast, Co. Antrim, Co. Down and Dublin, but contains pamphlets from all counties in Northern Ireland and some from the Republic of Ireland. Its principal use would be for the study of local church history, especially that of the major Protestant denominations in the 20 th Century. The items in this collection give an interesting insight into the affairs of individual congregations rather than the whole denomination. This collection is valuable for anyone studying Church history in Northern Ireland but can also benefit those studying social history and those interested in the demographics of Northern Ireland particularly sectarian related demographic changes after the beginning of the Troubles. The collection is particularly strong for the latter half of the 20 th Century but it includes earlier material, consideration of this collection as a whole may be particularly useful for understanding sectarian division in Northern Ireland during and after the Troubles.",<p>Approx. 460 individual pamphlets in 21 pamphlet boxes. <strong></strong></p>,Collection.Library.Text.Special,"<p><a>The collection is available for reference only under supervised access in the Special Collections Reading Room at The McClay Library.
