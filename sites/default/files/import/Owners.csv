The Presbytery of Ulster was created in 1642 by chaplains of the Scottish army. Under Cromwell church membership grew, but after the Restoration, nonconforming ministers were removed from parishes of the Established Church. Fortunately Presbyterianism was able to continue in spite of this pressure and persecution. From the 1690s, Presbyterian congregations were organised into the Synod of Ulster and enjoyed a level of religious freedom, but suffered continuing economic hardship and legal disabilities under the penal laws. Many Presbyterians strove to bring about reform and hence during the eighteenth century Presbyterians were involved in the United Irishmen. Tensions arose within the Synod of Ulster during this period which continued to linger into the nineteenth century. Eventually obligatory subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith was reintroduced which facilitated the union of the Synod of Ulster with the Seceders in 1840 to create the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. The united church has been active locally and internationally since then, seeing special growth during the Ulster revival of 1859. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland currently has over 240,000 members belonging to 545 congregations across 19 Presbyteries throughout the whole of Ireland.",,

This form of worship does not need a priest or clergyman to lead it or mediate between the Almighty and worshippers. The Meeting’s affairs are governed by regular meetings at which any member has a right to attend and speak. The Meeting has a chairperson, known as the Clerk, whose duty is to discern the feeling of the meeting and record it. No votes are ever taken. The Clerk’s job is to do the will of the meeting. It follows that decisions come up from the congregation, and are not handed down from the top. Similar meetings are held also at provincial and all–Ireland levels, at which matters affecting Friends are decided.

At about the same time Regiments of Militia were raised in counties Antrim, Down and Louth. All were eventually to be part of The Royal Irish Rifles which later became The Royal Ulster Rifles. The 83rd Regiment was raised in Dublin by Colonel William Fitch and soon saw active service in the West Indies. The 86th Regiment was originally raised in Shropshire by General Cornelius Cuyler and was known as ""Cuyler's Shropshire Volunteers"". However there was some difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers and on the regiment's move to Ireland they changed their main recruiting area to Leinster and became known as the ""Irish Giants"". The regiments saw active service in Egypt in the early 1800s and later in the Napoleonic Wars, where they were awarded many honours for their actions and bravery. The outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in 1857 found both Regiments in India and honours were again bestowed on members of the regiments. The next main event in the Regiment's history was the formation in 1881 of The Royal Irish Rifles. Many changes of dress, of title, of organisation and equipment followed, but the greatest of all was the conversion to a Rifle Regiment, which was regarded as a signal honour. It was in 1921 that the decision was made to change the name from The Royal Irish Rifles to The Royal Ulster Rifles. Finally in 1968 The Royal Ulster Rifles amalgamated with The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and The Royal Irish Fusiliers to form The Royal Irish Rangers, thus preserving the future of the Irish Regiments.",489,225

They believed that these children were being punished for their leaders' part in the First World War. As a result of an economic blockade imposed after the war to starve the politicians into submission, many children died.  Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton, were at the forefront of this campaign.  They felt campaigning had to go hand-in-hand with practical action.  Save the Children was launched in 1919 to send food to the suffering children. Within a few years, Save the Children gained a reputation as a highly effective relief agency.  Today Save the Children maintains its commitment to helping children in emergencies, while also campaigning for politicians to tackle the causes of war and environmental disasters.  In 1923 Save the Children's founder, Eglantyne Jebb, pioneered the world's first charter on children's rights. It promoted the principle that children were entitled to a good quality of life, and that governments, families and other adults were obliged to provide this. So instead of being seen as charity cases, children were portrayed as having rights which adults must fulfil.  By the end of the century, the ideas behind the charter had changed international thinking about children. In 1989 the charter formed the basis of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Convention is now the most widely recognised international law, having been signed by just about every country in the world.",495,230

It was officially established in 1929 as the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery on the opening of the museum building in that year. A municipal museum service had, however, been in operation since c. 1891 when a huge collection of some 60,000 items was bequeathed by the Rev. Canon John Grainger (1830-1891) of Broughshane, Co. Antrim, to Belfast Corporation. This collection, representing a lifetime’s scholarly interest in natural history and antiquities, contained a vast array of specimens, fossils, minerals, fine art, ethnographic objects, books and curios, and became a focus for further gifts and deposits. It was first housed in the then newly opened Belfast Central Library, before moving to purpose built accommodation in Botanic Gardens in 1929. From this time, the Museum served in effect as a national institution for the whole of Northern Ireland, receiving official recognition under the Museum Act of 1961. The building was then extended and government funding secured with the museum changing its name to the Ulster Museum. More recently, the Ulster Museum has joined forces with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum, the Ulster-American Folk Park and Armagh County Museum to form MAGNI (Museums And Galleries of Northern Ireland), a major network of national museums in Northern Ireland.

356,Northern Ireland Heritage Gardens Committee,72,,,,,"The Northern Ireland Heritage Gardens Committee began in 1980 as an informal group of five individuals with common cause, the nomination of gardens within Northern Ireland that were of outstanding international significance. The first task of the group was to produce a preliminary listing of gardens and parks in Northern Ireland and to submit details of them to the International Committee of Historic Gardens (a committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites). This was completed in 1982 and formed the basis of Northern Gardens which was published in association with the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society. In c. 1989, funding was secured to set up a dedicated archive of gardens in Northern Ireland. This work was conducted on behalf of the Committee by the Historic Gardens Consultant, Belinda Jupp, and resulted in the publication of the Heritage Gardens Inventory (1992), a detailed listing of significant gardens in the north of Ireland. Source material accumulated during the course of this 3-year project was deposited as part of the Monuments and Buildings Record in c. 1993 for further expansion and permanent preservation. By this time, membership of the Committee had grown to 13 and included a representative selection of interested persons including the then librarian of Queen's University, George Wheeler and the Principal Inspector of the Historic Monuments and Buildings Branch of the DoE, Dr Ann Hamlin. The committee currently operates out of this department, now known as the Environment and Heritage Service: Built Heritage, under the direction of Mr Terence Reeves-Smyth who now maintains the present Inventory.\n\nSource: Heritage Gardens Inventory, compiled by Belinda Jupp (Belfast, 1992)",681,333

Ltd.,,,,,,"The firm of John Andrews & Co., flax spinners, was established by John Andrews of Comber (1782-1864) in 1863, building on an existing family business that had been in place since the late 18th century. Having already worked with his father in the firm, James Andrews & Sons from 1812, John Andrews, embarked upon the re-organisation of the company in the 1860s with the construction of a new mill, re-establishing the company under his own name with his sons, James, John and Thomas as partners. Thomas Andrews (1843-1916) took over the direction of the new company on the death of his father in 1864. Under his leadership, the family business continued to flourish, benefiting from the growing strength and specialisation of the linen industry in Ulster at this time (linen was a major driving force in the economic development of the region). The company was then enlarged in 1907. Thomas Andrews was succeeded as Chairman by his son, John Miller Andrews (1871-1956) in 1916, and with his increasing political commitments (J.M. Andrews eventually went on to serve as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1940-43), he was himself replaced in 1927 by his son, John Ormrod, as Managing Director of John Andrews & Co. Ltd. The company continued operations as a flax-spinning mill until 1997, when falling demand finally brought about its closure.

By a further Act of 1831 the Board was increased to 24: 3 honorary members (Chichesters), the Sovereign of Belfast, MPs for Carrickfergus and Downpatrick and for the counties of Down and Antrim, and the sitting members; 4 were to retire annually. The electoral basis for the Harbour Commissioners was established by the Belfast Harbour Act of 1847 (updated 1883): a restricted franchise mainly based on rateable valuations in the city using plural voting. Commissioners served for 3 years with one-third retiring annually. This electoral process was abolished in 1979 by the Belfast Harbour Acts (Amendment) Order (NI).

114,Best Family,,,,,,"The Du Bordieu (or Dubourdieu) Best family are of Hugenot descent, the Du Bordieus having settled in Ireland sometime in the early part of the 17th century. Although no documentary evidence exists to establish the exact date, or the means by which they left France, the family tradition is that the Rev. Jean Armand Du Bordieu was, in his infancy, smuggled from France into England. As an adult, he came to Ireland about 1690 and was chaplain to Field Marshal Schomberg when the latter lost his life at the Battle of the Boyne. His son, Rev. John Du Bordieu, came to live in Ireland and his family claim him to be the progenitor of the Du Bordieu Bests in this country. A descendant of his, also called Rev. John Du Bordieu, was rector and vicar of Drumgorland and Drumballyroney, Co. Down from 1821 until his death in 1839. However, he is best remembered as an author of some distinction having written the 'Statistical Survey of the County Down' in 1802 and the 'Statistical Survey of the County Armagh' in 1812. Saumare,Z the eldest son of Reverend John, was born in Lisburn in December 1780 and was the British commander in 1802 when Martinique in the French West Indies was captured from the French. Over time, the family gradually dropped the ""Du Bordieu"" part of their name, reverting for whatever reason – probably marriage - to Best.  They became substantial tenant farmers in the parish of Aghagallon, Co. Antrim, under the Marquess of Hertford, under whom they purchased the leases of a number of smaller tenants during the 19th century before securing the estate of ‘The Cairn’ in Aghalee, Co. Armagh under the Land Purchase Act of 1885. In the twentieth century , the family seat was occupied by Robert Dubourdieu Best who led an active life in the field of agriculture and as treasurer of Aghalee parish Church for fifty years. Upon his death in the early 1970s, ownership passed to his son, William, who, in the tradition of his great-uncles, served in the British army and was decorated by  King George VI for bravery in the Second World War. Today, the family tradition is still alive and the manor-house is occupied by William's son, Robert.",453,91

(est. 1853) by Harland, in association with Wolff’s uncle, the Liverpool merchant and financier, Gustavus C. Schwabe (ca. 1813-97). Operations were located on the site of Hickson’s company on Queen’s Island, Belfast, an area reclaimed from the River Lagan by the Belfast Harbour Commissioners during the 1840s.The Company initially employed about 150-200 men. Although success was by no means guaranteed, Harland & Wolff benefited greatly from early orders placed by the Liverpool ship owners, J. Bibby & Sons & Company and later, from 1869, by Thomas Ismay (1837-99), owner of the White Star Line.  Both of these companies were at the forefront of technological changes in the shipbuilding industry and actively encouraged the construction of bigger and better ships and facilities for passengers and merchants alike in the hope of improving their share of the increasingly lucrative world shipping market. Harland & Wolff answered this call and became highly successful in the production of larger sized vessels, and later, the construction of passenger liners. At the height of their success, in 1921 the Company was worth an estimated £8.1 million, employing approx. 15,000 men and had produced over 430 ships and output in excess of 2.2 million gross tons since their foundation in 1862. Of the many celebrated and renowned productions, the Oceanic (1870) and the ill-fated Titanic (1911) loom large. Despite a brief revival fuelled by the needs of the Second World War, the downturn within the ship building industry has had an inevitable impact on the fortunes of Harland & Wolff. Since the launch of the Canberra in 1960, the Company has increasingly turned its attentions to other areas of maritime engineering. Today, Harland and Wolff focuses primarily on the offshore oil and gas industry, building floating production and drilling units designed for deep water use, although the construction of naval ships and luxury passenger liners remains secondary. The company is today 78% owned by the Norwegian shipping firm Fred. Olsen Energy.  See also: 'Shipbuilders to the world:125 years of Harland and Wolff, Belfast, 1861-1986,' Michael Moss and John R.

263,Southwell Charity Trustees,,,,,,"Southwell Charity The Southwell or Bluecoat School was founded in 1733  by the Rt. Hon. Edward Southwell MP (1705-55).  It was known at that time as the Southwell Charity or Almshouses and was designed by Southwell to support six old men and six old women and to educate and advance twelve poor girls and twelve poor boys who were to be brought up in the Church of Ireland religion and to be apprenticed to Protestant Masters and Mistresses of the Church of Ireland. Eight orphan boys and eight orphan girls were also to be lodged in the building and totally maintained and instructed. Adjoining the charity were residences for a schoolmaster and a schoolmistress and they, as well as the inmates of the almshouses, had a small garden each.  The financing of the charity was no trouble during the life of Southwell as the annual sum of £237 was designated for its maintenance. However, he stated in his will that any sum over £237 should belong to the owner of the Downpatrick estate, so that even as the cost of living went up year by year no more than £237 could go to the charity after his death. When he died in 1755, he left a lengthy list of rules for the way the school was to be run and how the foundation money was to be spent. Southwell's son, the 21st Baron de Clifford assumed responsibility for the school until he died childless in 1833 after which it eventually became the property of the 1st Baron Dunleath; and it has remained and still belongs to the Dunleath family.   The school has encountered mixed fortunes throughout its history. The financial restraints incurred because of Southwell's will, for example, prevented the school from being converted from primary to secondary status in the nineteenth century and when the school passed to John Mulholland, later 1st Baron Dunleath, he was forced to close the girls' school down. Towards the end of the century, the Commissioners of  Educational Endowments drafted a scheme in 1890 for the future management of the school which resulted in the Southwell school being merged with the Parochial School (founded in 1863). After Partition, the school came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education in Northern Ireland and in 1928 it had 193 pupils on its roll with a total of five teaching staff, three female and two male. In 1954, it was transferred to the Down County Education Committee and was closed down in 1959 when the pupils were moved according to their age to the recently opened Downpatrick Secondary Intermediate School (established in 1956) and Downpatrick Primary School (1959). The buildings still exist at the top of English Street, Downpatrick and the almshouses are still inhabited.

It aims to identify, record and protect the built, buried and underwater remains of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. The department originates from the establishment of the Government of Northern Ireland in 1921 when responsibilty for the protection and administration of ancient monuments located in the North of Ireland passed from the Commissioners of Public Works in Dublin who had exercised this right from 1869. This function was assumed as a minor function of the Works division of the Ministry of Finance at Stormont under the Ancient Monuments Act (Northern Ireland) of 1926. A dedicated body, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee, becoming the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council in 1937, was then set up to advise the Minister of Finance on relevant matters. In 1948, E.M. Jope was appointed as first Inspector of Ancient Monuments and, in 1950, 2 further inspectors, D.M. Waterman and A.E.P. Collins, were also appointed forming a new branch of the Ministry of Finance. In 1971, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council was replaced by the Historic Monuments Council with the passing of the Historic Monuments Act of that year. A planning order passed during the following year saw the creation of a separate Historic Buildings Council which was established under the Ministry of Development. In 1976 these two functions were combined with responsibility passing to the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland under which they have remained.",676,328

Charged with regulating trade and maintaining standards in the important mediaeval salt trade, the Salters' Company received its first royal licence from King Richard II in 1394. Then as now, salt was a vital ingredient in the preservation of food, indeed it was the only way of preserving meat over long winter months. Members of the Company formerly dealt not only in salt but were also 'Dry Salters' and dealt in flax, hemp, logwood, cochineal, potashes and chemical preparations. In 1918 the Salters' Company determined to re-establish its connection with the modern equivalent of its ancient trade by founding the Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry, initially to assist young chemistry students returning from the war to complete their studies. It is now the flagship of the Company's charitable activities. Today the Salters' Institute plays a major role in the support of chemistry teaching, the encouragement of young people to pursue careers in the UK chemical and allied industries, and the promotion of chemical education including the whole area of curriculum development. Whilst the Salters' Institute is the principal focus for the Company's charitable work, the Company also administers a number of other small charities including Almshouses at Watford and Maidenhead. In 1994 the Company initiated the Salters' City Foyer Project for the homeless, located in Smithfield in conjunction with Soho Housing Association and Centrepoint.
