He was a noted amateur astronomer and became the first Director of the Observatory. He embarked on a comprehensive programme of accurately measuring the positions of the stars, but was hindered by the death of Archbishop Robinson in 1794. Robinson’s successors took little interest in science, which resulted in the loss of a number of instruments originally ordered for the Observatory. However, Hamilton perservered with his astronomy, and also initiated a series of weather readings which are still carried out today at the meteorological station to the south of the main buildings.",101,413

He was fortunate in that before he took up his post, a new Archbishop was created – John George Beresford – who was an enthusiastic supporter of the Observatory, and, fortunately for the Observatory, rich. With this combination of ability and financial backing the Observatory flourished during the mid-19th century, acquiring the long-needed collection of good quality instruments – such as can be found in the telescope domes at the back of the building. It was during this period that Armagh became established as a scientific institution of national and international importance. Robinson was able to compile the first Armagh Catalogue of stars which he published in 1859. He retained a living as rector at Carrickmacross and used this to supplement his income as Director of the Observatory. He was a founder member of Armagh Natural History and Philosophical Society, President of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin and President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He married twice, his first wife was Elizabeth Rambaut and his second Lucy Jane Edgeworth (sister to Maria).",104,419

It stands close to the centre of the historic City of Armagh in attractive, landscaped grounds that include a scale model of the solar system and universe, known as the Armagh Astropark, and the Armagh Planetarium. The Observatory's main function is to undertake original research of a world-class academic standard which broadens and expands our understanding of astronomy. Current programmes, which have many practical applications, include investigations into the Sun and other stars, solar system astronomy, solar variability and the Earth's climate, and the Near-Earth-Object hazard to civilization. The Observatory also has a unique 200-year long meteorological record, the longest in the UK and Ireland from a single site. Full details of the Observatory's current research programmes are available from the web-site: http://star.arm.ac.uk/. Complementing this active research role, the Observatory is committed to a programme of public understanding of science. This includes visitors, primarily to the Armagh Astropark; presentations to groups; contacts with the press; and the development of a rich web-site to facilitate access to the latest research findings.

As a result of this agreement, environmentally controlled storage facilities were made available at the Museum for the receipt of BBC material and members of BBC staff appointed to administer it. Material was first received in 1990 with the transfer of significant holdings (pre-1988) from the BBC NI Sound Library, a dedicated computer database set up to record details of the collection and an administrative and research service established for both BBC staff and members of the public. Since then, the Archive has sought to integrate itself as part of the Northern Ireland network of research institutions ensuring public access to the collection through the provision of on-site listening and research facilities and the establishment of a Library Listening Scheme whereby copies of programmes are made available to the public through the NI Public Library network. Promotional events are also held and organised on an annual basis through which Archive staff seek to highlight the collection’s strengths. Although initially established to administer a Sound Archive, the BBC NI Archive has in recent years been allowed to expand with the receipt of BBC material held on other formats and media, the most significant of which being the BBC Northern Ireland Press Office collection of publicity photographs in 1999. Other such deposits continue to be received by the Archive and the original founding agreement of 1989 was amended in 2000 to take account of this development.",72,77

Central to the life of Friends in Lisburn is the Meeting for Worship at which any member may speak or pray when led by the Holy Spirit to do so. This form of worship does not need a priest or clergyman to lead it or mediate between the Almighty and worshippers. The Meeting’s affairs are governed by regular meetings at which any member has a right to attend and speak. The Meeting has a chairperson, known as the Clerk, whose duty is to discern the feeling of the meeting and record it. No votes are ever taken. The Clerk’s job is to do the will of the meeting. It follows that decisions come up from the congregation, and are not handed down from the top. Similar meetings are held also at provincial and all–Ireland levels, at which matters affecting Friends are decided. Rules for church government are contained in a slim 90-page volume called the Book of Discipline.

They believed that these children were being punished for their leaders' part in the First World War. As a result of an economic blockade imposed after the war to starve the politicians into submission, many children died.  Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton, were at the forefront of this campaign.  They felt campaigning had to go hand-in-hand with practical action.  Save the Children was launched in 1919 to send food to the suffering children. Within a few years, Save the Children gained a reputation as a highly effective relief agency.  Today Save the Children maintains its commitment to helping children in emergencies, while also campaigning for politicians to tackle the causes of war and environmental disasters.  In 1923 Save the Children's founder, Eglantyne Jebb, pioneered the world's first charter on children's rights. It promoted the principle that children were entitled to a good quality of life, and that governments, families and other adults were obliged to provide this. So instead of being seen as charity cases, children were portrayed as having rights which adults must fulfil.  By the end of the century, the ideas behind the charter had changed international thinking about children. In 1989 the charter formed the basis of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Convention is now the most widely recognised international law, having been signed by just about every country in the world.",177,495

For many years The Presbyterian College, Belfast was known affectionately as ""Assembly's""  being the College of the General Assembly of The Presbyterian Church in Ireland.  Magee Theological College began as the Theological Department of a College of Arts and Divinity  which opened in Londonderry in 1865, and later became Magee University College.  When the Arts side was incorporated into the New University of Ulster in 1971, the Theological College was transferred to Belfast, where it was united with the Presbyterian College to form the Union Theological College in 1978.

82,Belfast Ropeworks Company Limited,43,Rope Manufacturer,"Belfast Ropeworks Company Limited According to various sources, the first ropewalk was established in Belfast in 1758 and by 1860 there were about a dozen rope manufacturers employing altogether about two hundred workers. In order to cope with the rapid and enormous expansion of shipbuilding in the city, a number of local gentlemen acquired a small ropewalk on the banks of the Connswater River and in 1876 the Belfast Ropework Company was incorporated. Starting with 50 employees, this rose to 1,000 by 1888 and to 3,000 by 1900. The work was spread over four factories: the Bloomfield factory manufactured all classes of twine from the raw material right to the finished article; the Pottinger factory manufactured hard and soft fibre ropes and fishing nets of every description; the Connswater factory specialised in binder twine which was exported to all wheat-growing countries and had a world-wide reputation; the Cord factory produced all classes of soft fibre cords, baling ropes, garden and fishing lines. The scale of the whole operation in terms of the range of products and numbers employed established the firm as the largest manufacturer of rope and twine in the world in the early part of the twentieth century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                During the blitz of 1941 the Ropeworks was badly damaged by high explosive bombs and incendiaries but was almost back to full production within three months. Some idea of the firm's war effort can be judged by the quarter of a million camouflage nets made in addition to the colossal weight of ropes produced for mooring ships and barrage balloons, boom defence nets and scramble nets. After the war, the Ropeworks faced new difficulties.The decline in  demand for shop twine caused by the popularity of self-adhesive tape led to redundancies. Although in the early 1960s a decision was taken to move with the times by manufacturing certain synthetic fibres such as polythene yarn the Ropeworks, like many textile businesses, suffered generally because of the growth in synthetically-based products. Due to a loss of production, the Pottinger mill (including the famous ropewalk) was closed down in 1968 and as this trend continued, vacated property was let to outside interests such as a police training school. In 1972, the firm was taken over briefly by the McCleery L'Amie Group and, after 1976, operated as Connswater Properties Ltd. Today, because of urban redevelopment, nothing remains of the original Ropeworks.",121,450

A municipal museum service had, however, been in operation since c. 1891 when a huge collection of some 60,000 items was bequeathed by the Rev. Canon John Grainger (1830-1891) of Broughshane, Co. Antrim, to Belfast Corporation. This collection, representing a lifetime’s scholarly interest in natural history and antiquities, contained a vast array of specimens, fossils, minerals, fine art, ethnographic objects, books and curios, and became a focus for further gifts and deposits. It was first housed in the then newly opened Belfast Central Library, before moving to purpose built accommodation in Botanic Gardens in 1929. From this time, the Museum served in effect as a national institution for the whole of Northern Ireland, receiving official recognition under the Museum Act of 1961. The building was then extended and government funding secured with the museum changing its name to the Ulster Museum. More recently, the Ulster Museum has joined forces with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum, the Ulster-American Folk Park and Armagh County Museum to form MAGNI (Museums And Galleries of Northern Ireland), a major network of national museums in Northern Ireland.

337,Northern Ireland Heritage Gardens Committee,72,,"The Northern Ireland Heritage Gardens Committee began in 1980 as an informal group of five individuals with common cause, the nomination of gardens within Northern Ireland that were of outstanding international significance. The first task of the group was to produce a preliminary listing of gardens and parks in Northern Ireland and to submit details of them to the International Committee of Historic Gardens (a committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites). This was completed in 1982 and formed the basis of Northern Gardens which was published in association with the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society. In c. 1989, funding was secured to set up a dedicated archive of gardens in Northern Ireland. This work was conducted on behalf of the Committee by the Historic Gardens Consultant, Belinda Jupp, and resulted in the publication of the Heritage Gardens Inventory (1992), a detailed listing of significant gardens in the north of Ireland. Source material accumulated during the course of this 3-year project was deposited as part of the Monuments and Buildings Record in c. 1993 for further expansion and permanent preservation. By this time, membership of the Committee had grown to 13 and included a representative selection of interested persons including the then librarian of Queen's University, George Wheeler and the Principal Inspector of the Historic Monuments and Buildings Branch of the DoE, Dr Ann Hamlin. The committee currently operates out of this department, now known as the Environment and Heritage Service: Built Heritage, under the direction of Mr Terence Reeves-Smyth who now maintains the present Inventory.\n\nSource: Heritage Gardens Inventory, compiled by Belinda Jupp (Belfast, 1992)",381,681

Its Collection of Aerial Photographs now numbers over 440,000; these form an archive for scholarly study which can also be consulted by the general public. This enterprise began in 1945, when the Air Ministry made available an RAF aircraft and pilot for ten days in July to Dr J.K. St Joseph, then Lecturer in Geology. Similar arrangements in subsequent years allowed Dr St Joseph to follow a pioneering programme of photographic reconnaissance over much of Britain. The value for teaching and research in a variety of subjects of this growing collection of air-photographs led the University in 1948 to appoint him as its first Curator in Aerial Photography, supported from 1949 by a committee of management known as the Committee for Aerial Photography. The arrangement with the Air Ministry continued until 1963, but from 1959 increasing use was made of an Auster hired from Marshall's Flying Services Ltd, at Cambridge Airport. In 1962 this aircraft was purchased, and in 1965 it was replaced by the Cessna 337 which is still in use. Dr St Joseph's achievement and international standing were recognised in 1973 by appointment to a personal chair in Aerial Photographic Studies. On his retirement in 1980 Mr D.R. Wilson was appointed as Curator; he retired on 30th September 1998. The Cambridge University Committee for Aerial Photography (CUCAP) was joined by other related specialist departments at the University to form the Unit for Landscape Modelling in late 2000. Its overall aim is to provide a research and advisory service on all aspects of landscape monitoring, analysis and modelling to organisations with an interest in environmental issues.\n\n\nSource: <a href=""http://www.aerial.cam.ac.uk/"" target=""new_window"">http://www.aerial.cam.ac.uk/</a>.",388,687

It was officially established in 1929 as the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery on the opening of the museum building in that year. A municipal museum service had, however, been in operation since c. 1891 when a huge collection of some 60,000 items was bequeathed by the Rev. Canon John Grainger (1830-1891) of Broughshane, Co. Antrim, to Belfast Corporation. This collection, representing a lifetime’s scholarly interest in natural history and antiquities, contained a vast array of specimens, fossils, minerals, fine art, ethnographic objects, books and curios, and became a focus for further gifts and deposits. It was first housed in the then newly opened Belfast Central Library, before moving to purpose built accommodation in Botanic Gardens in 1929. From this time, the Museum served in effect as a national institution for the whole of Northern Ireland, receiving official recognition under the Museum Act of 1961. The building was then extended and government funding secured with the museum changing its name to the Ulster Museum. More recently, the Ulster Museum has joined forces with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum, the Ulster-American Folk Park and Armagh County Museum to form MAGNI (Museums And Galleries of Northern Ireland), a major network of national museums in Northern Ireland.\n\nSee also: A Museum in Belfast: A History of the Ulster Museum and its Predecessors, Noel Nesbitt (Ulster Museum, 1979)",391,689

Jean Armand Du Bordieu was, in his infancy, smuggled from France into England. As an adult, he came to Ireland about 1690 and was chaplain to Field Marshal Schomberg when the latter lost his life at the Battle of the Boyne. His son, Rev. John Du Bordieu, came to live in Ireland and his family claim him to be the progenitor of the Du Bordieu Bests in this country. A descendant of his, also called Rev. John Du Bordieu, was rector and vicar of Drumgorland and Drumballyroney, Co. Down from 1821 until his death in 1839. However, he is best remembered as an author of some distinction having written the 'Statistical Survey of the County Down' in 1802 and the 'Statistical Survey of the County Armagh' in 1812. Saumare,Z the eldest son of Reverend John, was born in Lisburn in December 1780 and was the British commander in 1802 when Martinique in the French West Indies was captured from the French.

They became substantial tenant farmers in the parish of Aghagallon, Co.

Eight orphan boys and eight orphan girls were also to be lodged in the building and totally maintained and instructed. Adjoining the charity were residences for a schoolmaster and a schoolmistress and they, as well as the inmates of the almshouses, had a small garden each.  The financing of the charity was no trouble during the life of Southwell as the annual sum of £237 was designated for its maintenance. However, he stated in his will that any sum over £237 should belong to the owner of the Downpatrick estate, so that even as the cost of living went up year by year no more than £237 could go to the charity after his death. When he died in 1755, he left a lengthy list of rules for the way the school was to be run and how the foundation money was to be spent. Southwell's son, the 21st Baron de Clifford assumed responsibility for the school until he died childless in 1833 after which it eventually became the property of the 1st Baron Dunleath; and it has remained and still belongs to the Dunleath family.   The school has encountered mixed fortunes throughout its history. The financial restraints incurred because of Southwell's will, for example, prevented the school from being converted from primary to secondary status in the nineteenth century and when the school passed to John Mulholland, later 1st Baron Dunleath, he was forced to close the girls' school down. Towards the end of the century, the Commissioners of  Educational Endowments drafted a scheme in 1890 for the future management of the school which resulted in the Southwell school being merged with the Parochial School (founded in 1863). After Partition, the school came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education in Northern Ireland and in 1928 it had 193 pupils on its roll with a total of five teaching staff, three female and two male.

Bibby & Sons & Company and later, from 1869, by Thomas Ismay (1837-99), owner of the White Star Line.  Both of these companies were at the forefront of technological changes in the shipbuilding industry and actively encouraged the construction of bigger and better ships and facilities for passengers and merchants alike in the hope of improving their share of the increasingly lucrative world shipping market. Harland & Wolff answered this call and became highly successful in the production of larger sized vessels, and later, the construction of passenger liners. At the height of their success, in 1921 the Company was worth an estimated £8.1 million, employing approx. 15,000 men and had produced over 430 ships and output in excess of 2.2 million gross tons since their foundation in 1862. Of the many celebrated and renowned productions, the Oceanic (1870) and the ill-fated Titanic (1911) loom large. Despite a brief revival fuelled by the needs of the Second World War, the downturn within the ship building industry has had an inevitable impact on the fortunes of Harland & Wolff. Since the launch of the Canberra in 1960, the Company has increasingly turned its attentions to other areas of maritime engineering. Today, Harland and Wolff focuses primarily on the offshore oil and gas industry, building floating production and drilling units designed for deep water use, although the construction of naval ships and luxury passenger liners remains secondary. The company is today 78% owned by the Norwegian shipping firm Fred. Olsen Energy.  See also: 'Shipbuilders to the world:125 years of Harland and Wolff, Belfast, 1861-1986,' Michael Moss and John R.

The department originates from the establishment of the Government of Northern Ireland in 1921 when responsibilty for the protection and administration of ancient monuments located in the North of Ireland passed from the Commissioners of Public Works in Dublin who had exercised this right from 1869. This function was assumed as a minor function of the Works division of the Ministry of Finance at Stormont under the Ancient Monuments Act (Northern Ireland) of 1926. A dedicated body, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee, becoming the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council in 1937, was then set up to advise the Minister of Finance on relevant matters. In 1948, E.M. Jope was appointed as first Inspector of Ancient Monuments and, in 1950, 2 further inspectors, D.M. Waterman and A.E.P. Collins, were also appointed forming a new branch of the Ministry of Finance. In 1971, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council was replaced by the Historic Monuments Council with the passing of the Historic Monuments Act of that year. A planning order passed during the following year saw the creation of a separate Historic Buildings Council which was established under the Ministry of Development.

The electoral basis for the Harbour Commissioners was established by the Belfast Harbour Act of 1847 (updated 1883): a restricted franchise mainly based on rateable valuations in the city using plural voting. Commissioners served for 3 years with one-third retiring annually. This electoral process was abolished in 1979 by the Belfast Harbour Acts (Amendment) Order (NI).

397,Salters' Company,,Company,"The Salters' Company, one of the Twelve Great City Livery Companies, has its origins in the City of London of the fourteenth century. Charged with regulating trade and maintaining standards in the important mediaeval salt trade, the Salters' Company received its first royal licence from King Richard II in 1394. Then as now, salt was a vital ingredient in the preservation of food, indeed it was the only way of preserving meat over long winter months. Members of the Company formerly dealt not only in salt but were also 'Dry Salters' and dealt in flax, hemp, logwood, cochineal, potashes and chemical preparations. In 1918 the Salters' Company determined to re-establish its connection with the modern equivalent of its ancient trade by founding the Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry, initially to assist young chemistry students returning from the war to complete their studies. It is now the flagship of the Company's charitable activities. Today the Salters' Institute plays a major role in the support of chemistry teaching, the encouragement of young people to pursue careers in the UK chemical and allied industries, and the promotion of chemical education including the whole area of curriculum development. Whilst the Salters' Institute is the principal focus for the Company's charitable work, the Company also administers a number of other small charities including Almshouses at Watford and Maidenhead. In 1994 the Company initiated the Salters' City Foyer Project for the homeless, located in Smithfield in conjunction with Soho Housing Association and Centrepoint.

The Council was formally constituted at a meeting in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on 3rd March 1905 at which the Duke of Abercorn was elected President and Dr. T.H. Gibson elected Secretary. The functions of the Council were defined as uniting the local unionist associations, binding Ulster Unionist MPs and their constituents, contributing to the formulation of parliamentary policy, and expressing the opinions of the broader movement. From this meeting, the Ulster Unionist Council have represented the interests of the Unionist community in Ulster from the Home Rule Crisis of 1912-14 and the setting up of the Northern Ireland State in 1921, through to the recent Troubles, Direct Rule, the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. It continues to meet and shape opinion today.
