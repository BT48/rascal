"The Armagh Observatory, founded in 1790 by Archbishop Richard Robinson, is the oldest continuously functioning astronomical research institute in Great Britain and Ireland. It stands close to the centre of the historic City of Armagh in attractive, landscaped grounds that include a scale model of the solar system and universe, known as the Armagh Astropark, and the Armagh Planetarium. The Observatory's main function is to undertake original research of a world-class academic standard which broadens and expands our understanding of astronomy. Current programmes, which have many practical applications, include investigations into the Sun and other stars, solar system astronomy, solar variability and the Earth's climate, and the Near-Earth-Object hazard to civilization. The Observatory also has a unique 200-year long meteorological record, the longest in the UK and Ireland from a single site. Full details of the Observatory's current research programmes are available from the web-site: <a href="" http://star.arm.ac.uk/"" target=""new_window""> http://star.arm.ac.uk/</a>. Complementing this active research role, the Observatory is committed to a programme of public understanding of science. This includes visitors, primarily to the Armagh Astropark; presentations to groups; contacts with the press; and the development of a rich web-site to facilitate access to the latest research findings. The Observatory grounds and Astropark are open to the public.

"The Northern Ireland Place Name Project was established in the Department of Irish and Celtic Studies in the School of Languages, Literatures and Arts at Queen's University Belfast with government funding in 1987 to research the names of physical features and settlements on the Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale map. The Project was to build up a computer database of the names, giving their origin, meaning, and any historical or other relevant information. In 1990 the work was extended to include all townlands and a publication programme was begun, thus fulfilling the aims of the Ulster Place Name Society ""to undertake a survey of Ulster place names"" and to publish the results for members. Seven volumes were produced 1992-7, on parts of Counties Antrim (2), Derry (1) and Down (4). After a gap in funding 1997-9, a new grant was obtained from the Arts and Humanities Research Board to produce two further volumes in the series (Fermanagh and Tyrone) and to work towards releasing the database online. In the meantime some support was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund for a travelling exhibition (Celebrating Ulster’s Townlands by Kay Muhr) and from the Community Relations Council and Ultach Trust for the writing of the first Dictionary of Ulster Place-Names (by Patrick McKay).

"The Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, recognised as a denomination within the Christian faith, has about seventy members in its Lisburn Meeting. ""Quaker"" is a nickname given to Friends, more than 300 years ago, by which they are sometimes best known today. Central to the life of Friends in Lisburn is the Meeting for Worship at which any member may speak or pray when led by the Holy Spirit to do so. This form of worship does not need a priest or clergyman to lead it or mediate between the Almighty and worshippers. The Meeting’s affairs are governed by regular meetings at which any member has a right to attend and speak. The Meeting has a chairperson, known as the Clerk, whose duty is to discern the feeling of the meeting and record it. No votes are ever taken. The Clerk’s job is to do the will of the meeting. It follows that decisions come up from the congregation, and are not handed down from the top. Similar meetings are held also at provincial and all–Ireland levels, at which matters affecting Friends are decided. Rules for church government are contained in a slim 90-page volume called the Book of Discipline.

"The Regiment dates back to the reign of George III, when in 1793 to meet the commitments of war with France, the 83rd and the 86th Regiments of Foot were raised. At about the same time Regiments of Militia were raised in counties Antrim, Down and Louth. All were eventually to be part of The Royal Irish Rifles which later became The Royal Ulster Rifles. The 83rd Regiment was raised in Dublin by Colonel William Fitch and soon saw active service in the West Indies. The 86th Regiment was originally raised in Shropshire by General Cornelius Cuyler and was known as ""Cuyler's Shropshire Volunteers"". However there was some difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers and on the regiment's move to Ireland they changed their main recruiting area to Leinster and became known as the ""Irish Giants"". The regiments saw active service in Egypt in the early 1800s and later in the Napoleonic Wars, where they were awarded many honours for their actions and bravery. The outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in 1857 found both Regiments in India and honours were again bestowed on members of the regiments. The next main event in the Regiment's history was the formation in 1881 of The Royal Irish Rifles. Many changes of dress, of title, of organisation and equipment followed, but the greatest of all was the conversion to a Rifle Regiment, which was regarded as a signal honour. It was in 1921 that the decision was made to change the name from The Royal Irish Rifles to The Royal Ulster Rifles. Finally in 1968 The Royal Ulster Rifles amalgamated with The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and The Royal Irish Fusiliers to form The Royal Irish Rangers, thus preserving the future of the Irish Regiments.","28",,"Royal Ulster Rifles Museum","5 Waring Street, Belfast",,,,,"6","BT1 2EW","http://rurmuseum.tripod.com","Research is only initiated by post to enable contributions to the costs.

"At the end of the First World War a group of volunteers in the UK spoke out against injustice to children in Germany and Austria. They believed that these children were being punished for their leaders' part in the First World War. As a result of an economic blockade imposed after the war to starve the politicians into submission, many children died.  Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton, were at the forefront of this campaign.  They felt campaigning had to go hand-in-hand with practical action.  Save the Children was launched in 1919 to send food to the suffering children. Within a few years, Save the Children gained a reputation as a highly effective relief agency.  Today Save the Children maintains its commitment to helping children in emergencies, while also campaigning for politicians to tackle the causes of war and environmental disasters.  In 1923 Save the Children's founder, Eglantyne Jebb, pioneered the world's first charter on children's rights. It promoted the principle that children were entitled to a good quality of life, and that governments, families and other adults were obliged to provide this. So instead of being seen as charity cases, children were portrayed as having rights which adults must fulfil.  By the end of the century, the ideas behind the charter had changed international thinking about children. In 1989 the charter formed the basis of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Convention is now the most widely recognised international law, having been signed by just about every country in the world.","29",,"Save the Children (NI)","Popper House, 15 Richmond Park, Finaghy, Belfast",,,,,"6","BT10 0HB","http://www.savethechildren.org.uk","Appointments made be made between the following hours: Monday - Friday 09.00 - 17.00",,"+44 (0)28  9043 1123","+44 (0)28 9043 1314","r.mcdonald@scfuk.ork.uk","56"

"The Centre for Migration Studies developed from the research library for the Ulster American Folk Park. This was in existence from 1980 approx. In 1990 the WELB on behalf of the 5 Education & Library Boards took over the running of the Library and appointed a Librarian (Christine McIvor) & Database Manager (John Winters). The library operated from a temporary building until 1993, when a new purpose built building was officially opened. At this stage a Senior Library Assistant/Clerical Officer (Mrs Christine Johnston) was also appointed by the WELB. In 1996 the Library was officially named Centre for Emigration Studies. A MSSc in Irish Migration Studies in conjunction with QUB was instigated in September 1996, taught by Dr John Lynch from QUB & Dr Patrick Fitzgerald from the UAFP. This continues to run successfully. The name of the Centre was changed to its present name in 1998 with the appointment of a Director – Dr Brian Lambkin. It was felt that Migration was a term which better explained the ethos of the Centre, by encompassing emigration, immigration, internal migration & return migration. Dr Patrick Fitzgerald was also appointed at this time to the CMS and is now Lecturer & Development Officer. The Centre has a Management Committee made up of the Scotch-Irish Trust and representatives from WELB, QUB and other interested organisations. The Centre continues to support the UAFP & its staff in their research, but is also involved in research, teaching & publication on its own behalf. We are a national centre for the research of Irish Migration history and researchers are always welcome to visit and use the collection and the Irish Emigration Database.

"The Ulster Folk & Transport Museum was officially established following the formal amalgamation of the Ulster Folk Museum and the transport section of the former Belfast Municipal Museum (later the Ulster Museum) in 1973, although the two had been operating together since 1967. Opening up to the public in 1964, the Ulster Folk Museum was constituted by legislation passed by the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1958. It was set up under the guidance of a Board of Trustees with the primary objective ""of illustrating the way of life, past and present, and the traditions of the people of Northern Ireland"". The Trustees were also empowered to ""take such other actions [e.g. research etc]…proper for the purpose of acquiring or disseminating knowledge of such way of life and traditions."" The Museum is based in extensive grounds purchased in 1961 and 1964 at Cultra, Co. Down and today ranks among Ireland's foremost visitor attractions. It comprises an open-air museum including a town area and three purpose-built in-door exhibition galleries. The Museum also maintains a library and research facility and operates a busy educational programme for schools. In 1998, the Museum was brought together as a national institution with the Ulster Museum, the Ulster-American Folk Park and Armagh County Museum to form the Museums And Galleries for Northern Ireland, known as MAGNI, a major network of national museums in Northern Ireland.

"Belfast Ropeworks Company Limited According to various sources, the first ropewalk was established in Belfast in 1758 and by 1860 there were about a dozen rope manufacturers employing altogether about two hundred workers. In order to cope with the rapid and enormous expansion of shipbuilding in the city, a number of local gentlemen acquired a small ropewalk on the banks of the Connswater River and in 1876 the Belfast Ropework Company was incorporated. Starting with 50 employees, this rose to 1,000 by 1888 and to 3,000 by 1900. The work was spread over four factories: the Bloomfield factory manufactured all classes of twine from the raw material right to the finished article; the Pottinger factory manufactured hard and soft fibre ropes and fishing nets of every description; the Connswater factory specialised in binder twine which was exported to all wheat-growing countries and had a world-wide reputation; the Cord factory produced all classes of soft fibre cords, baling ropes, garden and fishing lines. The scale of the whole operation in terms of the range of products and numbers employed established the firm as the largest manufacturer of rope and twine in the world in the early part of the twentieth century.  During the blitz of 1941 the Ropeworks was badly damaged by high explosive bombs and incendiaries but was almost back to full production within three months. Some idea of the firm's war effort can be judged by the quarter of a million camouflage nets made in addition to the colossal weight of ropes produced for mooring ships and barrage balloons, boom defence nets and scramble nets. After the war, the Ropeworks faced new difficulties.The decline in  demand for shop twine caused by the popularity of self-adhesive tape led to redundancies. Although in the early 1960s a decision was taken to move with the times by manufacturing certain synthetic fibres such as polythene yarn the Ropeworks, like many textile businesses, suffered generally because of the growth in synthetically-based products. Due to a loss of production, the Pottinger mill (including the famous ropewalk) was closed down in 1968 and as this trend continued, vacated property was let to outside interests such as a police training school. In 1972, the firm was taken over briefly by the McCleery L'Amie Group and, after 1976, operated as Connswater Properties Ltd. Today, because of urban redevelopment, nothing remains of the original Ropeworks.","43",,"Online Research Bank","Institute of Governance, Public Policy and Social Research, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast",,,,,"6","BT7 1NN","http://www.governance.qub.ac.uk/","This is a web based resource which may be accessed free of charge.","Principal Researcher ORB","+44 (0)28 9027 3585","+44 (0)28 9027 2551","k.lloyd@qub.ac.uk","76"
"EHS: Built Heritage forms an integral part of the Environment and Heritage Service for Northern Ireland, a government agency of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. It aims to identify, record and protect the built, buried and underwater remains of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. The department originates from the establishment of the Government of Northern Ireland in 1921 when responsibilty for the protection and administration of ancient monuments located in the North of Ireland passed from the Commissioners of Public Works in Dublin who had exercised this right from 1869. This function was assumed as a minor function of the Works division of the Ministry of Finance at Stormont under the Ancient Monuments Act (Northern Ireland) of 1926. A dedicated body, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee, becoming the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council in 1937, was then set up to advise the Minister of Finance on relevant matters. In 1948, E.M. Jope was appointed as first Inspector of Ancient Monuments and, in 1950, 2 further inspectors, D.M. Waterman and A.E.P. Collins, were also appointed forming a new branch of the Ministry of Finance. In 1971, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council was replaced by the Historic Monuments Council with the passing of the Historic Monuments Act of that year. A planning order passed during the following year saw the creation of a separate Historic Buildings Council which was established under the Ministry of Development. In 1976 these two functions were combined with responsibility passing to the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland under which they have remained.","44",,"Environment & Heritage Service: Built Heritage","5-33 Hill Street, Belfast",,,,,"6","BT1 2LA","http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/","Access is free of charge, although charges may be made for lengthy enquiries and those received on behalf of a commercial organisation.

"Situated in the beautiful Botanic Gardens, Belfast, the Ulster Museum is unique in Northern Ireland for its range of art, history and science collections and displays. It was officially established in 1929 as the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery on the opening of the museum building in that year. A municipal museum service had, however, been in operation since c. 1891 when a huge collection of some 60,000 items was bequeathed by the Rev. Canon John Grainger (1830-1891) of Broughshane, Co. Antrim, to Belfast Corporation. This collection, representing a lifetime’s scholarly interest in natural history and antiquities, contained a vast array of specimens, fossils, minerals, fine art, ethnographic objects, books and curios, and became a focus for further gifts and deposits. It was first housed in the then newly opened Belfast Central Library, before moving to purpose built accommodation in Botanic Gardens in 1929. From this time, the Museum served in effect as a national institution for the whole of Northern Ireland, receiving official recognition under the Museum Act of 1961. The building was then extended and government funding secured with the museum changing its name to the Ulster Museum. More recently, the Ulster Museum has joined forces with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum, the Ulster-American Folk Park and Armagh County Museum to form MAGNI (Museums And Galleries of Northern Ireland), a major network of national museums in Northern Ireland.

"The Northern Ireland Place Name Project was established in the Department of Irish and Celtic Studies in the School of Languages, Literatures and Arts at Queen's University Belfast with government funding in 1987 to research the names of physical features and settlements on the Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale map. The Project was to build up a computer database of the names, giving their origin, meaning, and any historical or other relevant information. In 1990 the work was extended to include all townlands and a publication programme was begun, thus fulfilling the aims of the Ulster Place Name Society ""to undertake a survey of Ulster place names"" and to publish the results for members. Seven volumes were produced 1992-7, on parts of Counties Antrim (2), Derry (1) and Down (4). After a gap in funding 1997-9, a new grant was obtained from the Arts and Humanities Research Board to produce two further volumes in the series (Fermanagh and Tyrone) and to work towards releasing the database online. In the meantime some support was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund for a travelling exhibition (Celebrating Ulster’s Townlands by Kay Muhr) and from the Community Relations Council and Ultach Trust for the writing of the first Dictionary of Ulster Place-Names (by Patrick McKay). The Project is currently being reviewed.

"Stranmillis University College is located in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Stranmillis College was founded in 1922 to provide state-funded teacher training in the northern portion of the then recently partitioned island. Until then most teachers in Ulster schools had been trained in Dublin. The new Northern Ireland government decided to open its own college and purchased for the purpose at Stranmillis House. Today the College is a multi-professional institution, no longer engaged solely in the education of teachers. It offers pre-service and in-service courses, undergraduate and postgraduate, for some 700 full-time students. All College courses lead to a qualification validated and awarded by the Queen's University of Belfast. In recent years the College has hosted a number of significant curriculum development projects in various subject areas and has published a range of support material for schools. The College has an especially close working relationship with St. Mary's College in Belfast. Joint teaching takes place within a number of subjects which are offered in both Colleges.

"University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin dates its origin from the foundation in 1851 of the Catholic University of Ireland. The ""Catholic University"" was set up as an alternative to the non-denominational Queen’s Colleges established by the Government in 1845, located in Belfast, Cork and Galway.  The Catholic University of Ireland opened officially in 1854 at no. 86 St. Stephen’s Green with Cardinal John Henry Newman as Rector. Some of the more celebrated literary figures associated with the early days of the University are Gerard Manley Hopkins, James Joyce and Austin Clarke.  The Constitution of the College dates from 1908 when it received its charter and was incorporated, together with the former Queen’s Colleges at Cork and Galway, as a constituent college of the National University of Ireland. This coincided with the move of University College Dublin, to new and larger premises in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. Earlsfort Terrace still houses the Medical Faculty, and part of the Engineering Faculty. In 1934 University College Dublin bought Belfield House and added a group of adjoining properties during the years 1949 to 1958. In 1960, the Government recommended that University College should move from the City centre to Belfield. The first buildings to be built on the campus were those of the Faculty of Science in 1964. The most recent building is the new Department of Computer Science building completed in 1999. Under the provisions of the Universities Act 1997, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin has been established as an autonomous university within the National University of Ireland. Today, University College Dublin with over 18,000 registered undergraduate and postgraduate students. International students on exchange programmes and full-degree programmes, make up approximately 1,500 of this number.

"Founded as Johnston & Company in 1819 and taken over by W.H. Smith in May 1850, the first Eason was appointed by Smith as his Manager in Dublin in 1856. Eason and his son, Charles, acquired the business in 1886. A branch was opened in Belfast in 1868. The firm prospered in both the 19th and 20th centuries, supplying firstly its railway bookstalls and subsequently its shops with the printed word in all its forms, newspapers, journals, books, stationery and writing requisites for the home and school, postcards, Catholic prayerbooks etc. Through the travelling representatives, stationery sales helped to secure orders for new products, and to build up the small town newsagent, who was usually a bookseller and stationer or a general merchant.

"The Ulster Women's Unionist Council was established on 23 January 1911. Initiated as the female equivalent to the main Ulster Unionist Council, it was established as an auxiliary organisation to oppose home rule, promote unionist propaganda and preserve the legislative union between Great Britain and Ireland. Led by members of Ulster's aristocratic elite, such as Mary Anne, 2nd Duchess of Abercorn and Theresa, 6th Marchioness of Londonderry, it became the largest female political association in early 20th century Ireland with a membership of between 115,000-200,000 by 1913 and a range of local branches throughout the north of Ireland. On the outbreak of World War I the organisation became engaged in extensive charity work, making arrangements to care for those who were discharged from the forces on medical grounds and inaugurating the Ulster Women's Gift Fund for Soldiers. After the Representation of the People Act in 1918 the movement became involved in the registration of women voters. Subsequent reorganisation involved speakers' classes, meetings that combined education with entertainment, and the holding of meetings outside Belfast to increase interest in the work of the Women's Council at a local level. Today the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist Council is located in Glengall Street, Belfast.","69",,"Dublin Institute of Technology Music & Drama Library","159 Rathmines Road, Dublin 6",,,,,"7",,"http://www.dit.ie/library/","See www.dit.ie/library/hours/.

"The Northern Ireland Heritage Gardens Committee began in 1980 as an informal group of five individuals with common cause, the nomination of gardens within Northern Ireland that were of outstanding international significance. The first task of the group was to produce a preliminary listing of gardens and parks in Northern Ireland and to submit details of them to the International Committee of Historic Gardens (a committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites). This was completed in 1982 and formed the basis of Northern Gardens which was published in association with the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society. In c. 1989, funding was secured to set up a dedicated archive of gardens in Northern Ireland. This work was conducted on behalf of the Committee by the Historic Gardens Consultant, Belinda Jupp, and resulted in the publication of the Heritage Gardens Inventory (1992), a detailed listing of significant gardens in the north of Ireland. Source material accumulated during the course of this 3-year project was deposited as part of the Monuments and Buildings Record in c. 1993 for further expansion and permanent preservation. By this time, membership of the Committee had grown to 13 and included a representative selection of interested persons including the then librarian of Queen's University, George Wheeler and the Principal Inspector of the Historic Monuments and Buildings Branch of the DoE, Dr Ann Hamlin. The committee currently operates out of this department, now known as the Environment and Heritage Service: Built Heritage, under the direction of Mr Terence Reeves-Smyth who now maintains the present Inventory.

As a young musician he traveled throughout Ireland, meeting and playing music with many of the legends of Irish music, and performing regularly on Irish radio and television. In 1976 he immigrated to America and settled in the Boston area.
